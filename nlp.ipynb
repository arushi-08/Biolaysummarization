      "Summarize this document. Text: In temperate climates , winter deaths exceed summer ones . However , there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality , by local climate , age group , sex and medical cause of death . We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions . Death rates in men and women ≥ 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August , driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries . In these ages , percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions , nor changed from 1980 to 2016 . Under five years , seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s . In adolescents and young adults , especially in males , death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January , driven by injury deaths . \n",
      " It is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year , and in temperate climates there tend to be more deaths in winter than in summer ( Campbell , 2017; Fowler et al . , 2015; Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) . It has therefore been hypothesized that a warmer world may lower winter mortality in temperate climates ( Langford and Bentham , 1995; Martens , 1998 ) . In a large country like the USA , which possesses distinct climate regions , the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically , due to geographical variations in mortality , localized weather patterns , and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating , air conditioning and healthcare ( Davis et al . , 2004; Braga et al . , 2001; Kalkstein , 2013; Medina-Ramón and Schwartz , 2007 ) . The presence and extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time ( Bobb et al . , 2014; Carson et al . , 2006; Seretakis et al . , 1997; Sheridan et al . , 2009 ) . A thorough understanding of the long-term dynamics of seasonality of mortality , and its geographical and demographic patterns , is needed to identify at-risk groups , plan responses at the present time as well as under changing climate conditions . Although mortality seasonality is well-established , there is limited information on how seasonality , including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality , varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death ( Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . In this paper , we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group , through the application of wavelet analytical techniques , to over three decades of national mortality data . Wavelets have been used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena ( Moy et al . , 2002 ) and infectious diseases ( Grenfell et al . , 2001 ) . We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality . In addition , we identify how the percentage difference between death rates in maximum and minimum mortality months has changed over time . \n",
      " The strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate seasonality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determinants and planning responses . \n",
      " We used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , we also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter temperatures . Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time or nationally , or fixed to pre-specified frequencies . Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in the USA ( Feinstein , 2002; Kalkstein , 2013; Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences . Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths , restricted to older ages , are broadly consistent with these studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) , which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . A study of 36 cities in the USA , aggregated across age groups and over time , also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range ( Kinney et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations ( Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) ( the study’s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated ) . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental ( e . g . housing insulation and heating ) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe . If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of ( unintentional ) injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) and are more common in men . The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first , the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined , and second , the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions , which exhibit limited seasonality ( Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and Figure 10—figure supplement 3 ) , increased ( MacDorman and Gregory , 2015 ) . In contrast to young and middle ages , mortality in older ages , where death rates are highest , maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades ( we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages , the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend ) . This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate . Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors , such as better insulation of homes , winter heating provision and flu vaccinations , for the vulnerable older population ( Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group ( Healy , 2003; Lerchl , 1998; Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions ( Morris , 2013 ) . Such interventions are important today , and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability . \n",
      " We used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Age , sex , state of residence , month of death , and underlying cause of death were available for each record . The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases ( ICD ) system ( 9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th revision of ICD thereafter ) . Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 ( Ingram et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation , assigning each yearly count to July . We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Figure 18 and Table 2 ) ( Karl and Koss , 1984 ) . On average , the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18 . 4°C and 18°C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature ( 27 . 9°C in July ) . The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast ( an average range of 17 . 5°C ) . The three coldest climate regions are West North Central , East North Central and the Northwest ( 7 . 6°C , 8 . 0°C , 8 . 2°C respectively ) . Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions , the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region , West North Central ( an average range of 30 . 5°C ) , which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature ( −6 . 5°C in January ) . The other climate regions , Northeast , Southwest , and Central , possess similar average temperatures ( 10°C to 14°C ) and variation within the year of ( 23°C to 26°C ) , with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States ( with 19 . 8% total population in 2016 ) . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4 , 5–14 , 15-24 , 25–34 , 35–44 , 45–54 , 55–64 , 65–74 , 75–84 , 85+ years . We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group , both nationally and for sub-national climate regions . Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months , by multiplying each month’s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month . For analysis of seasonality by cause of death , we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories ( Table 1 ) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note . Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56 . 4% and 21 . 2% of all deaths in the USA , respectively , in 1980 , and 40 . 3% and 22 . 4% , respectively , in 2016 . Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures ( Basu , 2009; Basu and Samet , 2002; Bennett et al . , 2014; Braga et al . , 2002; Gasparrini et al . , 2015 ) . Injuries , which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7 . 3% in 2016 , may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim , which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements ( Dee et al . , 2011 ) . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period . We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence , and frequency , of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series ( Hubbard , 1998; Torrence and Compo , 1998 ) . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere ( Cazelles et al . , 2008 ) , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time . In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white ( an independent random process ) or red ( autoregressive of order one process ) noise . For each age-sex group , we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period ( 1980–2016 ) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum , which represents random fluctuations . We used the R package WaveletComp ( version 1 . 0 ) for the wavelet analysis . Before analysis , we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression , and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and −1 . To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates , we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates . Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate . In taking the weighted average , we allowed December ( month 12 ) to neighbour January ( month 1 ) , representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean ( θ- ) of the angles ( θ1 , θ2 , θ3… , θn , ) representing the deaths ( with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death ) is found using the relation below:θ-=arg∑j=1nexp⁡ ( iθj ) , where arg denotes the complex number argument and θj denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j . The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value ( Fisher , 1995 ) . Along with each circular mean , a 95% confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples . The R package CircStats ( version 0 . 2 . 4 ) was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account . This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start ( 1980 ) and end ( 2016 ) of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death .. \n",

      "<start_of_turn>model\n",
      "In the USA , more deaths happen in the winter than the summer . But when deaths occur varies greatly by sex , age , cause of death , and possibly region . Seasonal differences in death rates can change over time due to changes in factors that cause disease or affect treatment . Analyzing the seasonality of deaths can help scientists determine whether interventions to minimize deaths during a certain time of year are needed , or whether existing ones are effective . Scrutinizing seasonal patterns in death over time can also help scientists determine whether large-scale weather or climate changes are affecting the seasonality of death . Now , Parks et al . show that there are age and sex differences in which times of year most deaths occur . Parks et al . analyzed data on US deaths between 1980 and 2016 . While overall deaths in a year were highest in winter and lowest in summer , a greater number of young men died during summer – mainly due to injuries – than during winter . Seasonal differences in deaths among young children have largely disappeared and seasonal differences in the deaths of older children and young adults have become smaller . Deaths among women and men aged 45 or older peaked between December and February – largely caused by respiratory and heart diseases , or injuries . Deaths in this older age group were lowest during the summer months . Death patterns in older people changed little over time . No regional differences were found in seasonal death patterns , despite large climate variation across the USA . The analysis by Parks et al . suggests public health and medical interventions have been successful in reducing seasonal deaths among many groups . But more needs to be done to address seasonal differences in deaths among older adults . For example , by boosting flu vaccination rates , providing warnings about severe weather and better insulation for homes . Using technology like hands-free communication devices or home visits to help keep vulnerable elderly people connected during the winter months may also help .<end_of_turn>\n",

Text: Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development , yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms . In the C . elegans germline , reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation . Here , we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway . This is surprising , since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors . Through a combination of genetics , tissue-specific transcriptome analysis , and functional studies of candidate genes , we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch . We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes , silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) , and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming . These findings have wide implications , ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling . \\n Cell-fate decisions are controlled , on the one hand , by intercellular signaling and , on the other hand , by intrinsic mechanisms such as epigenetic chromatin modifications . The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved and widespread signaling mechanism ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al . , 1999; Greenwald and Kovall , 2013 ) , which has been implicated in key cell-fate decisions such as the decision between proliferation and differentiation ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Notch signaling has also been implicated in cellular reprograming . Upon inhibition of Notch signaling , the oncogenic genes KLF4 and cMyc become dispensable for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) from mouse and human keratinocytes ( Ichida et al . , 2014 ) . In this setting , Notch inhibits reprograming . Conversely , Notch signaling promotes transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells to ductal cells ( Sawey et al . , 2007 ) , or the conversion of hepatocytes into biliary cells in liver primary malignancy intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) ( Sekiya and Suzuki , 2012 ) . Notch signaling can also affect reprograming in normal development . In C . elegans , signaling through the GLP-1 and LIN-12 Notch receptors impedes reprograming during embryogenesis and , during larval development , signaling through LIN-12 is required for the conversion of a rectal epithelial cell into a motorneuron ( Jarriault et al . , 2008; Djabrayan et al . , 2012 ) . The role of epigenetic regulators in cell-fate decisions has been studied mostly in pluripotent cells cultured outside of their normal tissue environment ( Meshorer and Misteli , 2006; Spivakov and Fisher , 2007; Lessard and Crabtree , 2010; Orkin and Hochedlinger , 2011 ) . Therefore , the\\xa0epigenetic regulation of stem cell identity in intact tissues remains poorly understood . Additionally , the impact of external cues , for example signaling from a stem cell niche to the recipient cell’s chromatin remains equally unresolved . By contrast , C . elegans has been used as a model to study reprograming in an intact organism ( Horner et al . , 1998; Fukushige et al . , 1998; Zhu et al . , 1998; Fukushige and Krause , 2005; Ciosk et al . , 2006; Jarriault et al . , 2008; Yuzyuk et al . , 2009; Riddle et al . , 2013 ) . In this model , germ cells can be directly reprogrammed into neurons by depleting specific chromatin modifiers such as LIN-53 ( Rbbp4/7 ) or components of PRC2 , and by concomitant overexpression of the transcription factor CHE-1 , which induces glutamatergic neuronal fate in a process which we refer to as Germ cell Conversion ( GeCo ) ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model . This was unanticipated , since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 ( henceforth GLP-1Notch ) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate ( Kimble and Crittenden , 2007 ) . To understand this novel , reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1Notch , we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling . We identified genes regulated by GLP-1Notch , including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , and unexpectedly , we found that many genes activated by GLP-1Notch signaling were also repressed by the cell fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PRC2 . We show that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target , utx-1 . Importantly , UTX-1 is a histone demethylase known to erase the gene-silencing methylation of histone H3 dependent on PRC2 ( Maures et al . , 2011; Jin et al . , 2011; Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , we propose that the GLP-1Notch–dependent induction of UTX-1 facilitates reprograming by alleviating PRC2-mediated repression of alternative cell fates . \\n Germ cells can be converted into neuronal cells in intact C . elegans upon overexpression of the neuronal transcription factor CHE-1 , simply by depleting the chromatin modifier LIN-53 ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . This GeCo phenotype can be followed in living animals by monitoring a reporter GFP expressed from the gcy-5 promoter , which otherwise is induced in glutamatergic ASE neurons ( Altun-Gultekin et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast to the spontaneous teratomatous differentiation of meiotic germ cells , observed in the absence of specific RNA-binding proteins ( Ciosk et al . , 2006; Biedermann et al . , 2009; Tocchini et al . , 2014 ) , GeCo is preferentially observed in the pre-meiotic , proliferating germ cells ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Consistently , removing the proliferating germ cells , by inhibiting GLP-1Notch signaling , prevents GeCo ( Tursun et al . , 2011 ) . However , because the proliferating germ cells were eliminated , these experiments did not address a possible direct effect of GLP-1Notch signaling on GeCo . We began addressing this issue by examining the gonads of animals carrying the gain-of-function glp-1 allele ( ar202 ) ( Pepper et al . , 2003 ) . These gonads are filled with proliferating germ cells and , upon depleting LIN-53 and overexpressing CHE-1 , we observed that significantly more germ cells converted to ASE neurons ( Figure 1A , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . We refer to this enhanced GeCo as 'GeCo+' . Detailed quantification revealed that the GeCo+ gonads contained more than twice the number of converted cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . The nuclei of these converted cells were reminiscent of neuronal nuclei and the cells displayed axo-dendritic projection ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) , as previously described ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . To confirm that the GeCo enhancement depends on the canonical Notch signaling pathway , rather than an independent function of the GLP-1Notch\\xa0receptor , we RNAi-depleted the transcriptional effector of GLP-1Notch signaling , LAG-1 ( Christensen et al . , 1996 ) . We exposed animals only after hatching to lag-1 RNAi in order to avoid sterility , which is caused when animals are subjected to lag-1 RNAi earlier ( Supplemental file 1 ) . RNAi-mediated knock-down of lag-1 strongly inhibited GeCo ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Importantly , under these experimental conditions , we did not observe any obvious reduction of germ cell numbers ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—source data 1 ) , suggesting a proliferation-independent effect of GLP-1Notch signaling on cell-fate conversion . To investigate this further , we tested GeCo efficiency on germ cells proliferating independently of GLP-1Notch signaling . We took advantage of mutants in which , in the absence of two meiosis/differentiation-promoting factors GLD-1 and GLD-2 , germ cells proliferate independently of GLP-1Notch ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998 ) . Specifically , we examined GeCo in the loss-of-function gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) mutants , which carried either wild-type glp-1 or the loss-of-function glp-1 ( q175 ) allele ( Austin and Kimble , 1987 ) . Both mutant combinations have previously been described to have tumorous germlines and impaired meiotic entry ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998; Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . In contrast to efficient GeCo observed in the gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) gonads , GeCo was strongly diminished in the gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads , despite the ongoing germ cell proliferation ( Figure 1D , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Counting the number of germ cells in these gonads revealed only a slight difference ( a 15% increase in the numbers in the double vs . triple mutant gonads ) , suggesting that the strong enhancement of GeCo by GLP-1Notch signaling cannot be explained by the\\xa0increased number of germ cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Since it has been proposed that dividing cells have a higher propensity for cellular reprograming ( Egli et al . , 2008; Hanna et al . , 2009 ) , we also tested whether blocking the cell cycle would affect the observed GeCo enhancement in glp-1 ( gf ) gonads . As previously described ( Fox et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) , we used hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment to block the cell cycle in the S phase . Blocking the cell cycle by HU did not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Combined , these results suggest that GLP-1Notch enhances GeCo independently from its role in promoting germ cell proliferation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 003Figure 1 . GLP-1Notch signaling promotes reprograming of germ cells . ( A ) GLP-1Notch enhances germ cell conversion ( GeCo ) into neuronal-like cells . Left: Fluorescent ( top ) and combined fluorescent/differential interference contrast ( DIC ) micrographs ( bottom ) of adult animals . All animals ectopically expressed the pro-neuronal transcription factor CHE-1 from a heat-shock promoter . glp-1 ( ar202 ) is a temperature-sensitive gain-of-function allele of the Notch receptor . Animals were subjected to either mock ( control ) or lin-53 RNAi . Reprogrammed cells expressed a GFP reporter driven from the neuronal gcy-5 promoter ( here an in other figures nGFP ) and are outlined here and elsewhere in yellow . Any signal outside the outlined region comes from somatic tissues . GeCo+ indicates animals that displayed a strongly enhanced GeCo phenotype . Scale bars = 10 μm . The cartoons depicting the GeCo and GeCo+ phenotypes are on the top right . The gonads are shaded in grey and GFP-positive converted germ cells are green . Fractions of animals displaying GeCo and GeCo+ are indicated below . At least 250 animals were quantified per condition . P-values were calculated using Student's t-test: p1<0 , 0001; p2=0 , 0006 . Error bars represent SEM . ( B ) The transcriptional effector of the GLP-1Notch signaling pathway , LAG-1 , is required for the GLP-1Notch–mediated enhancement of GeCo .

( A ) For the quantification of gcy-5::gfp-positive cells per gonadal arm only the GeCo category of wt vs . glp-1 ( gf ) was used because GeCo+ animals already show an extensive area of the gonad filled with gcy-5::gfp-positive cells with usually >100 cells/gonad making reliable counting impossible . Notably , animals with a seemingly similar extend of GeCo in wt vs . glp-1 ( gf ) show a clear increase of gcy-5::gfp-positive cells per gonadal arm from approx . 10 in wt to > 30 in glp-1 ( gf ) . n ( wt ) = 75 gonaldal arms , n ( glp-1 ( ar202 ) ) = 221 gonadal arms . The background of the loss of function allele glp-1 ( q175 ) leads to a significant decrease in GeCo as shown previously ( Tursun et al . , 2011 ) .

The inset in the corresponding DIC image , magnified in the right-bottom corner , shows the nuclear morphology of a converted germ cell , which has lost the germ cell-specific ‘fried-egg’-like shape and instead shows nuclear speckles characteristic of a neuronal cell .

The gonads were imaged by fluorescent microscopy using Z-stack acquisitions . Germ cells from the DTCs ( yellow asterisks ) to the turn of the gonad arm ( dashed lines ) were counted .

Blocking the cell cycle with hydroxyurea does not inhibit GeCo+ . ( A ) We used hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment for 5 hr to chemically block the cell cycle , which makes germ cells arrest in the S phase of the cell cycle . This arrest does not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype in glp-1 ( gf ) gonads upon lin-53 RNAi and che-1 ( oe ) . At least 150 animals were quantified per condition . P-values were calculated using Student's t-test: p1=0 , 1409; p2=0 , 4583 . Error bars represent SEM .

After 12 hr of HU treatment , the gonads contained , as expected , enlargement nuclei ( arrowheads ) ( Gartner et al . , 2004; Fox et al . , 2011 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 007 To understand the effects of GLP-1Notch on GeCo , we set out to identify genes regulated by GLP-1Notch signaling in germ cells . To conduct the\\xa0analysis in morphologically similar tissue , we again took advantage of the gld-1 gld-2 double mutants that , combined with either loss-of-function or gain-of-function glp-1 alleles , have morphologically similar gonads , filled with proliferating , undifferentiated germ cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998; Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . We combined gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) mutations with either the temperature-sensitive loss-of-function ( lf ) glp-1 allele ( e2144 ) , or the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function ( gf ) glp-1 allele ( ar202 ) ( Priess et al . , 1987; Pepper et al . , 2003 ) . Because GLD-1 and GLD-2 regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level only , we expected that transcriptionally regulated GLP-1Notch targets could be identified in this background . To analyze gene expression , gonads were dissected from animals grown at the restrictive temperature in two independent experiments , and transcripts were analyzed with tiling arrays ( GEO accession number GSE49395 ) . We identified around 100 transcripts that were differentially expressed between the gld-1 gld-2; glp-1 ( lf ) ( Notch OFF ) and gld-1 gld-2; glp-1 ( gf ) ( Notch ON ) gonads ( Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . These changes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR ( RT-qPCR ) on selected transcripts ( Figure 2—figure supplement2A , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Most differentially expressed transcripts were upregulated in the ‘Notch ON’ gonads , indicating a predominantly activating role of GLP-1Notch in germ cells . For simplicity , we will refer to the transcripts upregulated at least two fold in the Notch ON gonads as ‘Notch–activated’ . Some Notch-activated genes , such as sel-8/Mastermind , lst-1 , and epn-1/Epsin , have been implicated in Notch signaling in other cell types ( Doyle et al . , 2000; Yoo , 2004; Tian et al . , 2004; Singh et al . , 2011; Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . However , it remains possible that , rather than being direct GLP-1Notch targets , some of the Notch-activated genes were upregulated as an indirect consequence of increased GLP-1Notch signaling . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 008Figure 2 . GLP-1Notch and PRC2 regulate common targets and are functionally connected . ( A ) Notch-activated genes are biased for the sex chromosome linkage . Left: Changes in transcript abundance in the ‘Notch ON’ versus ‘OFF’ dissected gonads ( genotypes explained in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B ) were analyzed by microarrays . Transcripts upregulated at least 2-fold in the ‘Notch ON’ gonads are marked in red , those downregulated at least 2-fold in blue . Selected transcripts verified by RT-qPCR in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A are additionally circled in black . Right: 5426 genes can be considered expressed in the gonad , based on the bimodal distribution of expression values . Only 3% of those expressed genes are X-linked . In contrast , nearly half ( 46% ) of the expressed and Notch-activated transcripts are X-linked ( see Figure 2—figure supplement 2B for numbers ) . ( B ) GLP-1Notch and PRC2 interact genetically . Left: DAPI-stained gonads from animals of the indicated genotypes . The mes-2 ( bn11 ) M+Z- single mutant gonads have wild-type appearance at 20°C . The glp-1 ( ar202 ) gain-of-function mutants have an almost wild-type appearance at this temperature , except for an extended proliferative zone in the gonad , referred to as 'distal tumor' . At the same temperature , mes-2 ( bn11 ) M+Z-; glp-1 ( ar202 ) double mutants developed germline tumors in 32/32 of the examined gonads . The insets show close-ups from the indicated gonadal regions: the distal-most regions contain undifferentiated , proliferative germ cells in all mutants ( a , c , e ) . However , while the single mutants contain oocytes with characteristically condensed chromosomes in the proximal gonads ( b , d ) , the proximal gonads of the double mutants harbor proliferative germ cells ( f ) . Scale bar = 30 μm . Right: quantification of the phenotypes . 'Distal tumor' indicates the presence of an elongated distal proliferative zone ( approximately ½ of the distal gonad arm ) . 'Extended' tumor indicates an extended distal tumor , few oocytes , and frequently also a proximal tumor . 'Fully tumorous' indicates the absence of all differentiated cell types except for sperm produced during larval development . ( C ) GLP-1Notch and PRC2 target the same genes on the X chromosomes . The plots correlate changes in gene expression in M+Z- mes-2 mutants with changes in gene expression changes in M+Z- mes-6 mutants . Results are shown separately for X-linked ( left ) and autosomal ( right ) transcripts . Notch-activated genes ( red in Figure 2A ) are marked in red . Lightly shaded areas indicate transcripts that are at least 2-fold upregulated . The overlap between transcripts upregulated by GLP-1Notch and transcripts upregulated by the loss of CePRC2 is highly significant , particularly for the X-linked genes . The significance of the correlation was measured by hypergeometric distribution; X-linked Notch-activated vs . mes-2 derepressed: p=1 . 31e-31; X-linked Notch-activated vs . mes-6 de-repressed: p=7 . 41e-25; autosomal Notch-activated vs . mes-2 derepressed: p=1 . 47e-22; autosomal Notch-activated vs . mes-6 de-repressed: p=1 . 8e-12 .

Examining transcriptional effects of GLP-1Notch signaling . ( A ) GLP-1Notch signaling counteracts the meiosis-promoting activity of several RNA binding proteins , of which GLD-1 and -2 are indicated . ( B ) Mutants that were used in this study: while the loss-of-function ( lf ) alleles of glp-1 cause the loss of germ cells , gain-of-function ( gf ) alleles result in a constitutive proliferation of germ cells . However , in the absence of the meiosis-promoting GLD-1 and GLD-2 proteins , germ cells continue to proliferate in the absence of GLP-1Notch activity . ( C ) Three representative gonads of Notch ON: gld-2 ( q497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( ar202 ) and Notch OFF: gld-2 ( a497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( e2144 ) animals are shown after dissection and DAPI staining . The central planes of the gonads were imaged . Nuclei were counted from those images using the CellCounter plugin with ImageJ . For each genetic background , germ cells in the entire gonad of 10 dissected gonads were counted .

Nonetheless , the double mutant strain reacts to enhancers , suppressors , and depletion of PRC2 components in a similar manner as the glp-1 ( ar202 ) single mutant strain , with the exception of mbk-1 and B0416 . 5 RNAi . Depletion of mes-2 and mes-3 by RNAi was ineffective , since it did not enhance the tumourous phenotype in either of the two strains .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 013 To demonstrate that Notch-activated genes are functionally relevant for germ cell proliferation , we performed RNAi knockdown of Notch-activated genes ( n\\xa0=\\xa064 ) on animals carrying the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele , and screened for enhancement or suppression of the tumorous gonad phenotype ( Supplementary file 1; for detailed experimental procedure see Materials and Methods ) . Knocking down some of the Notch-activated genes suppressed the tumorous phenotype , which agrees with predominantly proliferation-promoting role of GLP-1Notch . Interestingly , knocking down a smaller\\xa0subset of the Notch-activated genes enhanced the tumor ( Supplementary file 1 ) , suggesting that some of the Notch-activated genes may counteract proliferation . While some of these genes may function autonomously in the germline , others could affect the germline indirectly from the soma . To test this , we RNAi-depleted selected candidates in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) mutant background , which is permissive for RNAi in the germline but deficient in RNAi in many ( but not all ) somatic tissues ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) . While depleting most candidates in the rrf-1 background had similar effects on the germline as in the wild type ( suggesting germline-autonomous function ) , in some cases the effects were abolished , suggesting that these genes function in the soma ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Strikingly , we noticed that Notch-activated genes were enriched on the X-chromosome , the C . elegans sex chromosome . 45% of the Notch-activated genes were X-linked , which is four-fold more than expected by chance ( p=2 . 99e-14; Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . When analyzing only genes with higher than baseline germline expression values , the disproportional X-linkage of Notch-activated genes was even more striking ( fifteen times more than expected by chance ( p=2 , 19e-38; Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . In the C . elegans germline , X-linked genes are largely silenced by the C . elegans PRC2 ( Fong et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , the X chromosome bias among Notch-activated genes suggested a possible antagonistic relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 . The C . elegans PRC2 consists of MES-2 , -3 , and -6 ( Bender et al . , 2004 ) and levels of the corresponding transcripts were essentially not altered by GLP-1Notch signaling ( mes-2: absolute fold change ( fc ) -1 . 3747; mes-3: fc 1 . 003; mes-6: fc 1 . 037 ) . To test for a functional relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 , we examined genetic interactions between GLP-1 and PRC2 mutants . At 20°C , both the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) and the homozygous loss-of-function mes-2 ( bn11 ) mutants , derived from heterozygous mothers providing maternal MES-2 ( mes-2\\u2009M+Z- mutants ) , were viable and produced gonads with nearly wild-type appearance . The double mes-2\\u2009M+Z-; glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutants , however , displayed distal and proximal tumors at the same temperature ( Figure 2B; 32/32 examined gonads ) . PRC2 and GLP-1Notch thus interact functionally , and they appear to do so in a germ cell autonomous manner ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Given the striking enrichment of Notch-activated genes on the X chromosome , and the genetic interaction between PRC2 and GLP-1Notch , we speculated that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 act on similar genes . To determine whether Notch-activated genes are also PRC2-repressed , we first determined putative PRC2 targets by expression analyses on isolated wild-type , M+Z- mes-2 or mes-6 mutant gonads ( GEO accession number GSE49395 ) . Consistent with the joint function of MES-2 and MES-6 in the PRC2 complex , a very similar set of genes was upregulated upon the loss of either protein ( Figure 2C; Figure 2—source data 1; henceforth ‘PRC2 repressed’ genes; also see ( Gaydos et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , those PRC2-repressed genes overlapped strongly with Notch-activated genes , particularly those linked to the X chromosome . Nearly all of the X-linked Notch-activated genes were also derepressed upon the loss of PRC2 ( Figure 2C ) . This is consistent with the observed genetic interaction and suggests that increased GLP-1Notch signaling can induce expression of specific PRC2-repressed genes . This activation of the PRC2-repressed genes is not due to a global loss of the repressive tri-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine residue 27 ( H3K27me3 ) , since , upon examining gonads of different GLP-1Notch mutants , we observed no global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . Germ cell conversion to neurons can be triggered not only by LIN-53 depletion but also by the depletion of PRC2 ( Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Potentially , the depletion of LIN-53 could facilitate reprograming by inhibiting PRC2 , since the depletion of LIN-53 results in a global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Considering the antagonistic relation between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 on cell proliferation and gene regulation , we wondered whether GeCo triggered by the depletion of PRC2 would be sensitive to Notch signaling . Indeed , GeCo was strongly enhanced in PRC2-depleted ( mes-2 , mes-3 or mes-6 RNAi ) animals , when they also carried the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele ( Figure 3A , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Moreover , similar to the LIN-53–depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 1D ) , the loss of GLP-1 effectively prevented GeCo in PRC2–depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 3B , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Together , these results suggest that GLP-1Notch stimulates GeCo in PRC2-compromised gonads . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 014Figure 3 . GLP-1Notch enhances reprograming upon the depletion of PRC2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 015 To determine how GLP-1Notch might counteract PRC2 , we depleted candidate Notch-activated genes ( Supplementary file 1 ) , and examined GeCo efficiency ( Figure 4A , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . The strongest suppression of the GeCo+ and GeCo phenotype was observed upon the depletion of utx-1 , which also suppressed mes-3 RNAi-mediated GeCo+ in glp-1 ( ar202 ) gonads ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Depletion of two other candidates , the uncharacterized C07G1 . 6 and the aldolase ortholog aldo-1 , also suppressed GeCo+ , albeit less efficiently ( Figure 4A ) . Because UTX-1 was suggested to effect gonadal development by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) , we re-examined GeCo efficiency upon utx-1 RNAi in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) background . Importantly , in rrf-1 mutants , RNAi is impaired in the somatic gonad , including the distal tip cell ( DTC ) , which constitutes the germline stem cell niche ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) . Because the suppression of GeCo+ upon utx-1 RNAi was observed also in the rrf-1 background , UTX-1 does not seem to enhance GeCo by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . Furthermore , different genetic backgrounds and RNAi agains utx-1\\xa0do not affect the expression levels of\\xa0CHE-1 in the germline ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 016Figure 4 . The H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 is required for GeCo enhancement . ( A ) UTX-1 is critical for GeCo enhancement . Candidate Notch-activated genes , selected from Supplementary file 2 with available RNAi clones , were assayed for a role in GeCo in glp-1 ( ar202 ) animals , expressing CHE-1–induced nGFP and treated with lin-53 RNAi . While the additional depletion of utx-1 had the strongest impact on GeCo+ and GeCo , the depletion of C07G1 . 6 and aldo-1 had a weaker effect .

UTX-1 is required for the GeCo+ enhancement upon the depletion of PRC2 . ( A ) Adult glp-1 ( ar202 ) animals treated with lin-53 or mes-3 RNAi were additionally subjected to either control or utx-1 RNAi . Depletion of utx-1 strongly suppressed the GeCo+ phenotype . Suppression upon utx-1 co-depletion with lin-53 is also detectable in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) background which is permissive for RNAi in the germline but not in the somatic gonad and the DTC .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 018 Importantly , utx-1 encodes a conserved H3K27me3 demethylase , an enzyme erasing the repressive mark deposited by PRC2 ( Agger et al . , 2007; Jin et al . , 2011; Maures et al . , 2011 ) , potentially explaining how its depletion impairs GeCo efficiency . However , a number of other H3K27me3 demethylases exist in C . elegans , which prompted us to test whether depletion of these demethylases might have an effect on GeCo in the glp-1 ( ar202 ) gonads . We RNAi-depleted jmjd-1 . 2 , encoding a H3K9/27me2 demethylase ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) , jmjd-3 . 1 , jmjd-3 . 2 , and jmjd-3 . 3 , which were reported to demethylate H3K27me2/3 ( Agger et al . , 2007; Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010; Zuryn et al . , 2014 ) , and , as a control , jmjd-2 , encoding a H3K9/36 demethylase ( Whetstine et al . , 2006; Greer et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . Only the depletion of JMJD-1 . 2 suppressed GeCo+ significantly , though to a lesser degree than the depletion of UTX-1 ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . The suppression of GeCo by the depletion of UTX-1 or JMJD-1 . 2 stresses the importance of counteracting PRC2 in reprograming . However , only the expression of utx-1 is activated by the GLP-1Notch signaling , suggesting that it is the activity of UTX-1 which is key for the reprograming dependent on GLP-1Notch signaling . The inhibition of GeCo enhancement upon utx-1 RNAi in the rrf-1 background suggested that UTX-1 functions in the germline . To test the potential expression of utx-1 in the germline , we constructed a strain expressing single copy-integrated , FLAG and GFP-tagged , functional UTX-1 ( expressed from the endogenous utx-1 promoter under the control of endogenous utx-1 3'UTR ) . We found that this protein was indeed expressed in the germline ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . To examine the potential transcriptional regulation of utx-1 expression by GLP-1Notch and PRC2 , we also created a strain expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B from the utx-1 promoter ( putx-1 reporter ) , under the control of an unregulated ( tbb-2 ) 3’UTR . This construct was also single-copy integrated into a defined genomic location . With both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the putx-1 reporter , we expected expression patterns similar to that of other reported GLP-1Notch target genes ( Lamont et al . , 2004; Lee et al . , 2006; Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Among these , lst-1 and sygl-1 account for the role of GLP-1Notch in stem cell maintenance , and both genes are expressed in the distal-most stem cells/progenitors ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . By contrast , both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the putx-1 reporter were little or not expressed in the distal-most , proliferative part of the germline ( Figure 5A–C; Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Concomitantly with progression through meiosis , their expression increased toward the proximal end of the gonad ( Figure 5A–C ) . When examining the existing mRNA hybridization patterns of Notch-activated and PRC2-repressed genes ( 33 genes ) , we noticed that half of these ( 18 , all X-linked ) are similarly expressed in the medial and/or proximal , but not the distal-most , gonads ( Supplementary file 2 ) , arguing against direct transcriptional activation of these genes by GLP-1Notch in the wild type . Nevertheless , in agreement with the expression analyses , we observed increased expression of the putx-1 reporter in PRC2-depleted gonads; this increase occurred throughout the gonad , including the distal-most region ( Figure 5A ) . In situ hybridization for the endogenous utx-1 transcript also showed increased expression throughout the gonad in the absence of PRC2 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . Moreover , expression of the putx-1 reporter was higher upon increased GLP-1Notch activity in glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutants , including the distal-most region where , in the wild\\xa0type , utx-1 is little or not expressed ( Figure 5B ) . Importantly , we found that the activation of the utx-1 promoter by Notch signaling was depended on the putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites within the promoter ( Yoo et al . , 2004 ) , as deleting those sites reduced reporter expression by approximately one-fourth ( Figure 5C ) . The interaction between LAG-1 and utx-1 was also tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) , performed on a strain expressing FLAG-tagged LAG-1 in either wild-type or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background ( Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) ; the previously identified GLP-1Notch targets , lst-1 and sygl-1 ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) , served as positive controls for the ChIP . Expectedly , we observed the enhanced binding of LAG-1 to the utx-1 promoter , indicating that utx-1 is a transcriptional target of GLP-1Notch signaling . Summarizing , based on the observations in mutant backgrounds , PRC2 and GLP-1Notch signaling have antagonistic effects on utx-1 transcription . However , in wild type , the endogenous levels of GLP-1Notch signaling are apparently insufficient to overcome PRC2-mediated repression of utx-1 in the distal-most part of the gonad . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 019Figure 5 .

Top: dissected gonads expressing a GFP reporter , driven from the utx-1 promoter ( putx-1::GFP , fused to histone 2B for nuclear localization to facilitate quantification ) , subjected to the indicated RNAi ( A ) , crossed into the indicated genetic background ( B ) or carrying the indicated mutations in the reporter gene ( C ) . a , b , and c indicate gonadal regions containing germ cells in mitosis ( a ) , and leptotene/zygotene ( b ) or pachytene ( c ) stages of meiosis .

Results are represented as average changes in the GFP intensity ( relative to mock RNAi-ed or untreated animals ) . The error bars represent SEM . The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for mes-2 ( RNAi ) ; n = 15 for mes-3 ( RNAi ) ; n = 29 for mes-6 ( RNAi ) , and n = 20 for the LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter . ( A ) The putx-1::GFP reporter is repressed by PRC2 . In all mes-depleted gonads , the reporter was de-repressed in proliferating cells ( a ) as well as in more proximal gonadal regions ( b-c ) . ( B ) The putx-1::GFP reporter is upregulated by GLP-1Notch . In the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutant , the reporter was strongly derepressed in the proliferating cells in the distal-most gonad ( a ) . Its expression was also increased in the more proximal regions ( b-c ) , which , in this mutant background , contain proliferating cells instead of meiotic cells . ( C ) putx-1::GFP expression depends on the predicted LAG-1/CSL binding sites in the promoter . Upon deletion of putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites , the reporter expression was abolished .

Lysates of animals expressing FLAG-tagged LAG-1 ( strain wgIs591; lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG ) , either in wild-type or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background , were subjected to ChIP-qPCR analysis of the indicated genes .

Worm lysates ( corresponding to 4 mg protein ) of animals , with or without lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG ( wgIs591 ) transgene , were used for ChIP . Samples were incubated with 50 µl of FLAG ( ‘specific’ FLAG antibody ) or HA antibodies ( ‘unspecific’ HA antibody ) coupled to µMACS microbeads ( Milteny ) . As negative control , lysate N2 or glp-1 ( ar202 ) worm lysates , which do not express the recombinant target protein , were used . Both negative control lysates did not show any differences during the ChIP experiment when tested with either specific antibody ( anti-FLAG coupled to µMACS beads ) or unspecific antibody ( anti-HA coupled to µMACS beads ) . Lysates of worms expressing the recombinant target protein in N2 or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background were incubated with specific ( anti-FLAG ) and unspecific ( anti-HA ) antibodies coupled to µMACS beads . The qPCR amplicons were tested in a minimum of three independent ChIP-qPCR experiments . Quantification results are shown as fold enrichment of anti-FLAG µMACS™ beads using wgIs591 lysate over anti-FLAG µMACS beads using lysate without wgIs591 ( no lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG ) . Primer for qPCRs ( sequence details above ) were designed using Primer3Plus ( Untergasser et al . , 2007 ) . The FLAG-beads using lysates with lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG show specific enrichment for tested target genes thereby validating the specificity of the ChIP .

Here , we report an unexpected role of GLP-1Notch signaling in promoting cell fate reprograming . To understand this phenomenon , we identified genes activated upon increased GLP-1Notch signaling . While the identified genes include the physiological GLP-1Notch targets , sygl-1 and lst-1 , many other genes , including utx-1 , appear to be only weakly or not expressed in the distal-most region of the wild-type gonad , where both sygl-1 and lst-1 are induced by GLP-1Notch ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , the wild-type levels of GLP-1Notch signaling are either insufficient to induce expression of many potential target genes ( see below ) , or their expression is controlled by additional mechanisms , perhaps similarly to lip-1 mRNA , which , while induced by GLP-1Notch , is post-transcriptionally degraded in the distal-most gonad ( Hajnal and Berset , 2002;\\xa0Lee et al . , 2006 ) . In addition to its major proliferation-promoting function , GLP-1Notch has been suggested to have a lesser role in promoting germ cell differentiation ( Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . Some of the identified Notch-activated genes appear to promote germ cell differentiation , potentially explaining the proposed differentiation-promoting function of GLP-1Notch . However , whether these genes are activated by GLP-1Notch and promote differentiation under physiological conditions remains to be determined . Many of the Notch-activated genes are repressed by PRC2 , suggesting that the expression of these genes is determined by the crosstalk between the extrinsic intercellular signaling pathway , Notch , and the intrinsic chromatin modifier PRC2 . Indeed , at least in the case of utx-1 , PRC2 appears to prevent its inappropriate expression in the distal-most gonad , which , nevertheless , can be overcome upon increased GLP-1Notch signaling . Our findings suggest that GLP-1Notch antagonizes PRC2 , at least in part , by stimulating expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 , which is essential for the enhancement of cellular reprograming . Previously , it was suggested that UTX-1 influences the germline by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) . However , by using the rrf-1 background , which displays defective RNAi in the somatic gonad , including the\\xa0DTC ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , we found that the reprograming-promoting role of UTX-1 is unlikely to depend on its function in the somatic gonad . Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the reprograming-facilitating role of UTX-1 depends on its expression in another somatic tissue ( such as the intestine , in which RNAi remains functional in the rrf-1 mutant; Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , the germline expression of UTX-1 reported here suggests a germline-autonomous function . Consistent with this hypothesis , manipulating either PRC2 or GLP-1Notch affected the germline expression of utx-1 . Although additional factors , such as the uncharacterized C07G1 . 6 and the ortholog of the human aldolase A ( Kuwabara and O'Neil , 2001; Shaye and Greenwald , 2011 ) might contribute to reprograming , they appear to be less critical . In addition to UTX-1 , another H3K27/H3K9-demethylating enzyme , JMJD-1 . 2 ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) , is required for enhanced reprograming . Similar to UTX-1 , JMJD-1 . 2 is likely to be directly involved in regulating chromatin accessibility , since its depletion results in increased levels of the repressive H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 modifications ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) . The reprograming-promoting role of JMJD-1 . 2 might indicate that , besides further demethylation of H3K27me2 , perhaps also the removal of H3K9me2 facilitates GeCo . Future studies will shed light on this interesting question . UTX-1 orthologs in other species contribute to tissue-specific chromatin signatures , for example during myogenesis or in cardiac development ( Seenundun et al . , 2010; Lee et al . , 2012 ) , and have been implicated in germ-cell and somatic reprograming ( Mansour et al . , 2012 ) . Together with our data , these findings underscore the importance of UTX-1 in cellular reprograming . Here , we suggest that one way the activity of UTX-1 may be stimulated to promote reprograming is through its Notch signaling-dependent transcriptional activation . Interestingly , an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PRC2 has also\\xa0been observed in T-cell leukemia ( Ntziachristos et al . , 2012 ) . A fascinating possibility is that a regulatory principle described here could help explain the etiology of this and perhaps other human diseases linked to a pathological increase in Notch signaling . \\n Standard procedures were used to maintain animals . Worms ( RRID:WB_DL226 ) were grown at 25°C unless stated otherwise . All heat-shock and temperature-sensitive strains were kept at 15°C . The C . elegans lines used in this study are listed and described in detail in the Supplementary file 3A . The enhancer-suppressor screen on Notch targets was performed by feeding the animals with bacteria containing RNAi clones from the Ahringer and Vidal RNAi libraries . The clones not present in either of these libraries were cloned using primers as described in detail in the Supplementary file 3B . Experiments were performed at 15°C , 20°C or 25°C using bleached embryos or overnight-synchronized L1 animals as stated in Supplementary file 1 . The percentage of adult animals with the germline tumor phenotype was scored . To test germ-cell autonomy , RNAi clones that induced significant suppression or enhancement in either setting were re-tested in a strain carrying the glp-1 ( ar202 ) ( RRID:WB_GC833 ) allele and , additionally the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) ( RRID:WB_NL2098 ) mutation , which impairs RNAi primarily in the soma ( Sijen et al . , 2001 ) . For this test , gravid adults were picked to RNAi plates and allowed to lay eggs overnight at the semi-permissive temperature of 20°C . Progeny was scored for enhancement or suppression of the germline tumorous phenotype at the young adult stage by DAPI staining of dissected gonads and scoring gonads as either wild-type , as containing a proximal or distal tumor but still some eggs , or as completely tumorous . Reprograming experiments were carried out as F1-RNAi . Worms were put on RNAi plates and the following F1 generation was screened for phenotypes . Used RNAi clones are described in the Supplementary file 3B . The genotype of the worms used for germ cell reprograming assays is BAT28 ( otIs305 ntIs1 , RRID:WB_OH9846 , details in Supplemental Materials and methods ) . Animals were synchronized by bleaching and eggs were put on NGM-agar containing E . coli OP50 ( RRID:WB_OP50 ) as a\\xa0food source to grow at 15°C until worms reached the L4-stage . At this stage 15–20 worms were put per well of a 6-well plate , containing bacteria expressing dsRNA or carrying an empty RNAi vector , and grown at 15°C until most of the F1 progeny reached the L3/L4 stage . The plates were heat-shocked at 37°C for 30\\u2009min followed by an overnight incubation at 25°C . Next day ( ~16\\u2009hrs post heat-shock ) the plates were screened for progeny showing ectopic GFP induction in the germline . To induce the Glp\\xa0phenotype in glp-1 ( ar202 ) , the animals were shifted to room temperature 9\\u2009hrs before the heat-shock . For double RNAi , bacteria were grown as saturated culture . The OD600 was measured to ensure that the bacteria were mixed in an appropriate 1:1 ratio and subsequently seeded on RNAi 6-well plates . The RNAi screen was performed as described above . The p-values were calculated using Student's t-test . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment was carried out as previously described ( Fox et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . HU was added to seeded RNAi-plates at a final concentration of 250 µM . L4 worms ( strain BAT32 , details in Supplementary file 3A ) grown on RNAi-plates were transferred to HU plates and incubated at room temperature for 5\\u2009hrs prior to heat-shock in order to induce CHE-1 expression . To test HU efficiency , control animals were treated with HU for 12\\u2009hrs with subsequent staining for DAPI and H3Ser10ph ( pH3 ) antibody ( Abcam #ab5176 ) . After overnight incubation , the worms were assessed for GFP induction in the germline as described above . To assess the efficiency of the HU treatment , the E . coli strain MG1693 ( E . coli stock center ) , with incorporated 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine ( EdU ) , was used to feed L3/L4 worms . EdU in combination with DAPI staining was performed similar to the procedure described previously ( Ito and McGhee , 1987 ) and according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Invitrogen , Europe ) of the EdU labeling kit . The Click-iT EdU reaction buffer ( Invitrogen , Europe ) was mixed with Alexa Fluor azide ( ‘click’ reaction ) dye to detect cells that were replicating DNA . Staining was performed by freeze cracking worms after fixation with 2% formaldehyde . Parental animals were raised at 15°C and shifted to 25°C for egg laying . Offspring was dissected after the L4-adult transition . Fifty gonads per analyzed genotype in triplicates were dissected in M9 containing levamisole . RNA was isolated using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . Total RNA ( 200 ng for the Notch ON/OFF experiments or 100 ng for the mes/wild-type experiments ) was amplified using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Amplified Double Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The Affymetrix GeneChip WT Double-Stranded cDNA Terminal Labeling Kit was used for the fragmentation and labeling of 7 . 5\\u2009μg cDNA . The labeled material was loaded onto Affymetrix GeneChip C . elegans Tiling 1 . 0R Arrays and hybridized at 65ºC for 16\\u2009hrs . The arrays were washed in an Affymetrix Fluidics station with the protocol FS450_0001 and scanned in an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 with autoloader using Affymetrix GCC Scan Control v . 3 . 0 . 0 . 1214 software . All tiling arrays were processed in R ( 32 , 33 ) using Bioconductor ( 34 ) and the packages tilingArray and preprocessCore . The arrays were RMA background corrected and log2 transformed on the oligo level using the following command: expr <- log2 ( rma . background . correct ( exprs ( readCel2eSet ( filenames , rotated = TRUE ) ) ) ) . We mapped the oligos from the tiling array ( bpmap file from www . affymetrix . com ) to the C . elegans genome assembly ce6 ( www . genome . ucsc . edu ) using bowtie ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) , allowing no error and unique mapping position . Expressions for individual transcripts were calculated by intersecting the genomic positions of the oligos with transcript annotation ( WormBase WS190 ) and averaging the intensity of the respective oligos . For the mes-4/wt experiment , no quantile normalization was performed as the distributions for the mes-4 mutant and the wt differed substantially . In the case of the Notch ON/OFF dataset quantile normalization was performed on the level of transcripts . The p-values were calculated in R with the hypergeometric distribution function 'phyper' . RNA was isolated as described above . cDNA was synthesized with oligo dT primer using the ImProm II Reverse Transcription System from Promega according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was used for qPCR with the Absolute QPCR SYBR Green ROX Mix ( AbGene ) on an ABI PRISM 7700 system ( Applied Biosystems ) . qPCR reactions were performed as described previously ( Biedermann et al . , 2009 ) . At least one primer in each pair is specific for an exon-exon junction . Sequences of the used primers are described in detail in the Supplementary file 3C . Mouse RNA was added before RNA isolation and reverse transcription , allowing for normalization to cyt-c and thereby correcting for variations in RNA isolation and reverse transcription . Standard curves for quantification were generated from a serial dilution of input cDNA for each primer pair . The amount of target present in each replicate was derived from the standard curve; an average was calculated for each of the triplicates . To compare total mRNA levels , the qPCR results were normalized to mouse cyt-c and to the C . elegans tubulin gene tbb-2 , and fold enrichments were calculated . RNA in situ hybridization was performed and analyzed as previously described ( Biedermann et al . , 2009 ) . Description of the primer pairs to generate probes from cDNA can be found in the Supplementary file 3C . Images were captured with a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope , equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc camera . Images were taken in linear mode of the Axiovision software ( Zeiss ) and processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner . ChIP was performed as described ( Askjaer et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , worms ( strains OP591 , RRID:WB_OP591 , and BAT890 ) were washed with M9 buffer and frozen as ‘worm popcorn’ in liquid nitrogen prior to pulverization with a mortar and pestle . The powder was dissolved in 10 volumes of 1 , 1% formaldehyde in PBS + 1\\xa0mM PMSF and incubated 10\\u2009mins with gentle rocking at room temperature with subsequent quenching for 5\\u2009mins at room temperature by adding 2 , 5 molar glycine ( final concentration 125\\u2009mM ) . After centrifugation with 4 . 000\\u2009g at 4°C the pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS+1\\xa0mM PMSF and resuspended in 50\\u2009mM FA buffer ( 50\\u2009mM HEPES/KOH pH 7 , 5; 1\\xa0mM EDTA; 1% Triton-X 100; 0 , 1% sodium deoxycholate; 150\\u2009mM NaCl ) + 1% sarkosyl + protease-inhibitors . Samples were sonicated twice using the Biorupter ( 15 times 30 s ON , 30 s OFF ) on high settings at 4°C followed by spinning at 13 . 000\\u2009g , 15\\u2009min , 4°C . The supernatant corresponding to 4 mg of protein measured by Bradford assay was used for ChIPs . Samples were incubated with 50 µl of FLAG or HA antibodies coupled to µMACS microbeads ( Milteny ) ( all blocked with 5% milk in FA-buffer ) . After incubating 1\\u2009hr at 4°C , the beads where washed in µMACS matrix columns in a magnetic rack with FA buffer containing 1\\xa0M and 0 . 5\\u2009M NaCl and subsequent wash with TE and TEL buffer ( 0 , 25\\u2009M LiCl; 1% Sodium deoxycholate; 1\\u2009mM EDTA; 10\\u2009mM Tris pH 8 , 0 ) . Bound material was eluted with 65°C pre-warmed 125 µl ChIP elution buffer ( 1% SDS , 250\\u2009mM NaCl , 10\\u2009mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1\\u2009mM EDTA ) and fixation was reversed using 2 µl of 10 mg/ml Proteinase K at at 50°C for 1\\u2009hr followed by 65°C incubation overnight . DNA was purified using the Quiaquick PCR purification kit in a final volume of 40 µl and 1 µl was used for qPCR . Negative controls were used to assess the quality of the ChIP and fold enrichment of the target genes: lysates ( N2 worms ) which do not express the recombinant target protein with specific antibody ( anti-FLAG coupled to µMACS beads ) and lysates of worms expressing the recombinant target protein with unspecific antibody ( anti-HA coupled to µMACS beads ) controls , respectively . Primer for qPCRs was designed using Primer3Plus ( Untergasser et al . , 2007 ) with the following settings: amplified region min . 100 bp – max . 200 bp; GC content: 50–60%; min . primer length: 18 nt – max . length 24 nt; melting temperature: min . 58°C – max . 63°C; max . ; 3' self complementary allowance set to 1; max . allowed length of a mononucleotide repeat ( max . poly-x ) : 3 . Sequences of the used primers are listed in in the Supplementary file 3C . The qPCRs were run on CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System from BioRad using the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix ( 2X ) . The data analysis was performed by calculating the ΔΔCt-values . Differences were assessed using Student's t-test . Worms were transferred to a slide and fixed by adding 10–20 µl 95% ethanol and letting evaporate the ethanol . The ethanol fixation was repeated 2 more times before adding the DAPI solution in microscopy mounting media ( vectashield from Vector or similar ) . The samples were sealed with a coverslip and nail polish before microscopy . Fluorescent micrographs were recorded with Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and the SensicamII camera ( PCO ) and the micromanager software was used to capture Z-stack images with 0 . 5 µm slice steps . Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times . Counting of germ cells within the range from the DTC to the turn of gonadal arms of glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; hsp::che-1; gcy-5::gfp animals treated with either mock or lin-53 RNAi was performed using the Z-stacks . Micromanager was used to control the Z-stack levels and the ImageJ plugin for cell counting for scoring the number of germ cells . Germ cell counts in gonads of Notch ON: gld-2 ( q497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( ar202 ) and Notch OFF: gld-2 ( a497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( e2144 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) and germline tumor phenotype in glp-1 ( ar202 ) and glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) were scored after dissection , formaldehyde fixation and DAPI staining . For Notch ON and Notch OFF mutants , the central plane of the gonads was imaged and germ cells in the entire dissected gonad were counted using the CellCounter plugin with ImageJ . For each of the two strains , germ cells in the entire gonad of 15 dissected gonads were counted . Antibody stainings of intact worms were performed using a freeze-crack procedure as described ( Duerr , 2006 ) . In brief , after washing , worms were resuspended in 0 . 025% glutaraldehyde , and frozen between two frost-resistant glass slides on dry ice . Separating the glass slides while frozen creates additional cracks in the cuticle . Acetone/methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1\\xa0M phosphate buffer for 1\\u2009hr on ice fixation was used . Worms were washed off the slides in PBS , blocked with 0 . 2% gelatin + 0 . 25% Triton in PBS , and stained . Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS with 0 . 1% gelatin and 0 . 25% Triton and fixed worms were incubated 4\\u2009hrs - overnight at 4°C . After PBS washes secondary antibody was applied for 3\\u2009hrs . After PBS washes worms were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium ( Dianova , #CR-38448 ) on glass slides . The primary antibodies used were anti-H3K27me3 ( 1:400; gift from Dr . Hiroshi Kimura ) ; anti-HA ( 1:100 , Roche #12CA5; acetone fixation ) ; anti-H3Ser10ph ( 1:400 , Abcam , #ab14955; acetone fixation ) . Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor dyes applied at 1:1000 dilution . Stainings for H3K27me3 on dissected gonads were performed using anti-H3K27me3 from Millipore ( catalogue number 07–449 , Lot 1959680; courtesy of Jan Padeken , Gasser laboratory ) on dissected gonads . The\\xa0adult animals were dissected in M9 containing levamisole , fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS on poly-lysine coated slides , snap-frozen on dry ice , freeze-cracked , incubated for 5 mins in ice-cold DMF at −20° , washed for 5\\u2009mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 at room temperature , blocked for 20\\u2009mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 + 5% BSA and incubated with the primary antibody over night at 4°C . Secondary antibodies ( Alexa 488 , goat anti rabbit , 1:500 ) were applied for 2\\xa0hrs at room temperature . Slides were then washed three times for 5\\u2009mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 at room temperature and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI . The transcriptional reporter gene putx-1::gfp-h2b ( rrrSi185 ) was constructed from the 1302 bp putative promoter region of the gene utx-1 ( human UTX ( Ubiquitously transcribed TPR on X ) homolog - 1 ) fused to sequences encoding for GFP-H2B and the ubiquitously expressed tbb-2 3’UTR using the Gateway Reporter Cloning System ( Merritt et al . , 2008 ) . The reporter gene putx-1::gfp-h2b ( rrrSi185 and rrrSi281 ) was constructed with the following primers: putx-attB4: GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGGGATTTTATCTTCATCGGACCTG putx-attB1 : GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGTGGCGGTGTGAGAAGCGATAC The full-length functional transgene putx-1::flag-gfp-utx-1::utx-1 3’UTR ( rrrSi189 ) was constructed with the following primers: utx-1+3UTR+attB2 L ggggacagctttcttgtacaaagtggACGACGAATCAGAACCTCTGCCGGAGGAGCGTCATgtaag utx-1+3UTR+attB3 R ggggacaactttgtataataaagttgaatgcggatactgccttctc The functional UTX-1 transgene putx-1::flag-gfp-tev::utx-1::utx-1 3’utr ( rrrSi189 ) contains the same promoter as the transcriptional reporter , the full-length utx-1 genomic sequence as well as the endogenous 3’UTR , and was equipped with N-terminal GFP , FLAG , and TEV tags . Transgenic animals were produced\\xa0as\\xa0single-copy integrants\\xa0using the MosSCI direct insertion protocol ( Frøkjaer-Jensen et al . , 2008 ) . The rrrSi189 transgene is functional , as it rescues the utx-1 mutant ( ok3553 allele ) . For GFP quantification , gonads were dissected from live animals in M9 buffer containing levamisole and mounted to glass microscopy slides ( Frøkjaer-Jensen et al . , 2008 ) . Fluorescent micrographs were recorded with Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and a Zeiss Axioncam MRm REV 2 CCD camera was used to capture images . Fluorescence intensities were quantified using ImageJ . GFP intensities were normalized to the picture background and corrected with the average autofluorescences measured in wild type ( N2 ) gonads at the corresponding temperatures . Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times and were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner . The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for glp-1 ( gf ts ) ; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for mes-2 ( RNAi ) ; n = 15 for mes-3 ( RNAi ) ; n = 29 for mes-6 ( RNAi ) , and n = 20 for LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter . Alleles used were glp-1 ( ar202 ) and mes-2 ( bn11 ) . Worms were grown at the semi-permissive temperature of 20°C and gonads were dissected and DAPI-stained shortly after the L4-young adult transition . The experiment was performed twice . In a first round , a low number of gonads were examined to identify whether the double mutant had a phenotype and to define phenotypic categories to score . Based on the observation of a clear and penetrant phenotype , gonads were scored in a second round according to the categories defined in the first round .. \\n        Summary:<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}]"

      "Given this text: In temperate climates , winter deaths exceed summer ones . However , there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality , by local climate , age group , sex and medical cause of death . We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions . Death rates in men and women ≥ 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August , driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries . In these ages , percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions , nor changed from 1980 to 2016 . Under five years , seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s . In adolescents and young adults , especially in males , death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January , driven by injury deaths . \n",
      " It is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year , and in temperate climates there tend to be more deaths in winter than in summer ( Campbell , 2017; Fowler et al . , 2015; Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) . It has therefore been hypothesized that a warmer world may lower winter mortality in temperate climates ( Langford and Bentham , 1995; Martens , 1998 ) . In a large country like the USA , which possesses distinct climate regions , the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically , due to geographical variations in mortality , localized weather patterns , and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating , air conditioning and healthcare ( Davis et al . , 2004; Braga et al . , 2001; Kalkstein , 2013; Medina-Ramón and Schwartz , 2007 ) . The presence and extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time ( Bobb et al . , 2014; Carson et al . , 2006; Seretakis et al . , 1997; Sheridan et al . , 2009 ) . A thorough understanding of the long-term dynamics of seasonality of mortality , and its geographical and demographic patterns , is needed to identify at-risk groups , plan responses at the present time as well as under changing climate conditions . Although mortality seasonality is well-established , there is limited information on how seasonality , including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality , varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death ( Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . In this paper , we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group , through the application of wavelet analytical techniques , to over three decades of national mortality data . Wavelets have been used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena ( Moy et al . , 2002 ) and infectious diseases ( Grenfell et al . , 2001 ) . We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality . In addition , we identify how the percentage difference between death rates in maximum and minimum mortality months has changed over time . \n",
      " The strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate seasonality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determinants and planning responses . \n",
      " We used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , we also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter temperatures . Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time or nationally , or fixed to pre-specified frequencies . Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in the USA ( Feinstein , 2002; Kalkstein , 2013; Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences . Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths , restricted to older ages , are broadly consistent with these studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) , which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . A study of 36 cities in the USA , aggregated across age groups and over time , also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range ( Kinney et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations ( Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) ( the study’s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated ) . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental ( e . g . housing insulation and heating ) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe . If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of ( unintentional ) injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) and are more common in men . The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first , the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined , and second , the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions , which exhibit limited seasonality ( Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and Figure 10—figure supplement 3 ) , increased ( MacDorman and Gregory , 2015 ) . In contrast to young and middle ages , mortality in older ages , where death rates are highest , maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades ( we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages , the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend ) . This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate . Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors , such as better insulation of homes , winter heating provision and flu vaccinations , for the vulnerable older population ( Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group ( Healy , 2003; Lerchl , 1998; Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions ( Morris , 2013 ) . Such interventions are important today , and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability . \n",
      " We used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Age , sex , state of residence , month of death , and underlying cause of death were available for each record . The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases ( ICD ) system ( 9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th revision of ICD thereafter ) . Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 ( Ingram et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation , assigning each yearly count to July . We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Figure 18 and Table 2 ) ( Karl and Koss , 1984 ) . On average , the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18 . 4°C and 18°C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature ( 27 . 9°C in July ) . The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast ( an average range of 17 . 5°C ) . The three coldest climate regions are West North Central , East North Central and the Northwest ( 7 . 6°C , 8 . 0°C , 8 . 2°C respectively ) . Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions , the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region , West North Central ( an average range of 30 . 5°C ) , which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature ( −6 . 5°C in January ) . The other climate regions , Northeast , Southwest , and Central , possess similar average temperatures ( 10°C to 14°C ) and variation within the year of ( 23°C to 26°C ) , with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States ( with 19 . 8% total population in 2016 ) . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4 , 5–14 , 15-24 , 25–34 , 35–44 , 45–54 , 55–64 , 65–74 , 75–84 , 85+ years . We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group , both nationally and for sub-national climate regions . Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months , by multiplying each month’s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month . For analysis of seasonality by cause of death , we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories ( Table 1 ) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note . Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56 . 4% and 21 . 2% of all deaths in the USA , respectively , in 1980 , and 40 . 3% and 22 . 4% , respectively , in 2016 . Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures ( Basu , 2009; Basu and Samet , 2002; Bennett et al . , 2014; Braga et al . , 2002; Gasparrini et al . , 2015 ) . Injuries , which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7 . 3% in 2016 , may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim , which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements ( Dee et al . , 2011 ) . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period . We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence , and frequency , of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series ( Hubbard , 1998; Torrence and Compo , 1998 ) . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere ( Cazelles et al . , 2008 ) , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time . In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white ( an independent random process ) or red ( autoregressive of order one process ) noise . For each age-sex group , we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period ( 1980–2016 ) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum , which represents random fluctuations . We used the R package WaveletComp ( version 1 . 0 ) for the wavelet analysis . Before analysis , we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression , and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and −1 . To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates , we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates . Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate . In taking the weighted average , we allowed December ( month 12 ) to neighbour January ( month 1 ) , representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean ( θ- ) of the angles ( θ1 , θ2 , θ3… , θn , ) representing the deaths ( with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death ) is found using the relation below:θ-=arg∑j=1nexp⁡ ( iθj ) , where arg denotes the complex number argument and θj denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j . The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value ( Fisher , 1995 ) . Along with each circular mean , a 95% confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples . The R package CircStats ( version 0 . 2 . 4 ) was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account . This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start ( 1980 ) and end ( 2016 ) of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death .. \n",

       "'In the USA , more deaths happen in the winter than the summer . But when deaths occur varies greatly by sex , age , cause of death , and possibly region . Seasonal differences in death rates can change over time due to changes in factors that cause disease or affect treatment . Analyzing the seasonality of deaths can help scientists determine whether interventions to minimize deaths during a certain time of year are needed , or whether existing ones are effective . Scrutinizing seasonal patterns in death over time can also help scientists determine whether large-scale weather or climate changes are affecting the seasonality of death . Now , Parks et al . show that there are age and sex differences in which times of year most deaths occur . Parks et al . analyzed data on US deaths between 1980 and 2016 . While overall deaths in a year were highest in winter and lowest in summer , a greater number of young men died during summer – mainly due to injuries – than during winter . Seasonal differences in deaths among young children have largely disappeared and seasonal differences in the deaths of older children and young adults have become smaller . Deaths among women and men aged 45 or older peaked between December and February – largely caused by respiratory and heart diseases , or injuries . Deaths in this older age group were lowest during the summer months . Death patterns in older people changed little over time . No regional differences were found in seasonal death patterns , despite large climate variation across the USA . The analysis by Parks et al . suggests public health and medical interventions have been successful in reducing seasonal deaths among many groups . But more needs to be done to address seasonal differences in deaths among older adults . For example , by boosting flu vaccination rates , providing warnings about severe weather and better insulation for homes . Using technology like hands-free communication devices or home visits to help keep vulnerable elderly people connected during the winter months may also help .'"

      "<start_of_turn>user: In temperate climates , winter deaths exceed summer ones . However , there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality , by local climate , age group , sex and medical cause of death . We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions . Death rates in men and women ≥ 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August , driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries . In these ages , percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions , nor changed from 1980 to 2016 . Under five years , seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s . In adolescents and young adults , especially in males , death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January , driven by injury deaths . \n",
      " It is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year , and in temperate climates there tend to be more deaths in winter than in summer ( Campbell , 2017; Fowler et al . , 2015; Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) . It has therefore been hypothesized that a warmer world may lower winter mortality in temperate climates ( Langford and Bentham , 1995; Martens , 1998 ) . In a large country like the USA , which possesses distinct climate regions , the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically , due to geographical variations in mortality , localized weather patterns , and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating , air conditioning and healthcare ( Davis et al . , 2004; Braga et al . , 2001; Kalkstein , 2013; Medina-Ramón and Schwartz , 2007 ) . The presence and extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time ( Bobb et al . , 2014; Carson et al . , 2006; Seretakis et al . , 1997; Sheridan et al . , 2009 ) . A thorough understanding of the long-term dynamics of seasonality of mortality , and its geographical and demographic patterns , is needed to identify at-risk groups , plan responses at the present time as well as under changing climate conditions . Although mortality seasonality is well-established , there is limited information on how seasonality , including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality , varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death ( Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . In this paper , we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group , through the application of wavelet analytical techniques , to over three decades of national mortality data . Wavelets have been used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena ( Moy et al . , 2002 ) and infectious diseases ( Grenfell et al . , 2001 ) . We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality . In addition , we identify how the percentage difference between death rates in maximum and minimum mortality months has changed over time . \n",
      " The strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate seasonality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determinants and planning responses . \n",
      " We used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , we also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter temperatures . Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time or nationally , or fixed to pre-specified frequencies . Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in the USA ( Feinstein , 2002; Kalkstein , 2013; Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences . Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths , restricted to older ages , are broadly consistent with these studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) , which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . A study of 36 cities in the USA , aggregated across age groups and over time , also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range ( Kinney et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations ( Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) ( the study’s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated ) . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental ( e . g . housing insulation and heating ) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe . If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of ( unintentional ) injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) and are more common in men . The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first , the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined , and second , the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions , which exhibit limited seasonality ( Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and Figure 10—figure supplement 3 ) , increased ( MacDorman and Gregory , 2015 ) . In contrast to young and middle ages , mortality in older ages , where death rates are highest , maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades ( we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages , the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend ) . This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate . Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors , such as better insulation of homes , winter heating provision and flu vaccinations , for the vulnerable older population ( Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group ( Healy , 2003; Lerchl , 1998; Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions ( Morris , 2013 ) . Such interventions are important today , and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability . \n",
      " We used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Age , sex , state of residence , month of death , and underlying cause of death were available for each record . The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases ( ICD ) system ( 9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th revision of ICD thereafter ) . Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 ( Ingram et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation , assigning each yearly count to July . We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Figure 18 and Table 2 ) ( Karl and Koss , 1984 ) . On average , the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18 . 4°C and 18°C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature ( 27 . 9°C in July ) . The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast ( an average range of 17 . 5°C ) . The three coldest climate regions are West North Central , East North Central and the Northwest ( 7 . 6°C , 8 . 0°C , 8 . 2°C respectively ) . Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions , the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region , West North Central ( an average range of 30 . 5°C ) , which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature ( −6 . 5°C in January ) . The other climate regions , Northeast , Southwest , and Central , possess similar average temperatures ( 10°C to 14°C ) and variation within the year of ( 23°C to 26°C ) , with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States ( with 19 . 8% total population in 2016 ) . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4 , 5–14 , 15-24 , 25–34 , 35–44 , 45–54 , 55–64 , 65–74 , 75–84 , 85+ years . We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group , both nationally and for sub-national climate regions . Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months , by multiplying each month’s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month . For analysis of seasonality by cause of death , we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories ( Table 1 ) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note . Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56 . 4% and 21 . 2% of all deaths in the USA , respectively , in 1980 , and 40 . 3% and 22 . 4% , respectively , in 2016 . Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures ( Basu , 2009; Basu and Samet , 2002; Bennett et al . , 2014; Braga et al . , 2002; Gasparrini et al . , 2015 ) . Injuries , which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7 . 3% in 2016 , may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim , which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements ( Dee et al . , 2011 ) . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period . We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence , and frequency , of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series ( Hubbard , 1998; Torrence and Compo , 1998 ) . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere ( Cazelles et al . , 2008 ) , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time . In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white ( an independent random process ) or red ( autoregressive of order one process ) noise . For each age-sex group , we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period ( 1980–2016 ) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum , which represents random fluctuations . We used the R package WaveletComp ( version 1 . 0 ) for the wavelet analysis . Before analysis , we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression , and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and −1 . To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates , we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates . Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate . In taking the weighted average , we allowed December ( month 12 ) to neighbour January ( month 1 ) , representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean ( θ- ) of the angles ( θ1 , θ2 , θ3… , θn , ) representing the deaths ( with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death ) is found using the relation below:θ-=arg∑j=1nexp⁡ ( iθj ) , where arg denotes the complex number argument and θj denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j . The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value ( Fisher , 1995 ) . Along with each circular mean , a 95% confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples . The R package CircStats ( version 0 . 2 . 4 ) was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account . This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start ( 1980 ) and end ( 2016 ) of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death .  <end_of_turn>\n",

      "<start_of_turn>model: In the USA , more deaths happen in the winter than the summer . But when deaths occur varies greatly by sex , age , cause of death , and possibly region . Seasonal differences in death rates can change over time due to changes in factors that cause disease or affect treatment . Analyzing the seasonality of deaths can help scientists determine whether interventions to minimize deaths during a certain time of year are needed , or whether existing ones are effective . Scrutinizing seasonal patterns in death over time can also help scientists determine whether large-scale weather or climate changes are affecting the seasonality of death . Now , Parks et al . show that there are age and sex differences in which times of year most deaths occur . Parks et al . analyzed data on US deaths between 1980 and 2016 . While overall deaths in a year were highest in winter and lowest in summer , a greater number of young men died during summer – mainly due to injuries – than during winter . Seasonal differences in deaths among young children have largely disappeared and seasonal differences in the deaths of older children and young adults have become smaller . Deaths among women and men aged 45 or older peaked between December and February – largely caused by respiratory and heart diseases , or injuries . Deaths in this older age group were lowest during the summer months . Death patterns in older people changed little over time . No regional differences were found in seasonal death patterns , despite large climate variation across the USA . The analysis by Parks et al . suggests public health and medical interventions have been successful in reducing seasonal deaths among many groups . But more needs to be done to address seasonal differences in deaths among older adults . For example , by boosting flu vaccination rates , providing warnings about severe weather and better insulation for homes . Using technology like hands-free communication devices or home visits to help keep vulnerable elderly people connected during the winter months may also help . <end_of_turn>\n",

      "<start_of_turn>user: Whether complement dysregulation directly contributes to the pathogenesis of peripheral nervous system diseases , including sensory neuropathies , is unclear . We addressed this important question in a mouse model of ocular HSV-1 infection , where sensory nerve damage is a common clinical problem . Through genetic and pharmacologic targeting , we uncovered a central role for C3 in sensory nerve damage at the morphological and functional levels . Interestingly , CD4 T cells were central in facilitating this complement-mediated damage . This same C3/CD4 T cell axis triggered corneal sensory nerve damage in a mouse model of ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . However , this was not the case in a T-dependent allergic eye disease ( AED ) model , suggesting that this inflammatory neuroimmune pathology is specific to certain disease etiologies . Collectively , these findings uncover a central role for complement in CD4 T cell-dependent corneal nerve damage in multiple disease settings and indicate the possibility for complement-targeted therapeutics to mitigate sensory neuropathies . \n",
      " Dysregulated complement activation is increasingly recognized as a significant pathological event in a variety of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases of the central nervous system ( Tenner et al . , 2018 ) . These include conditions from Alzheimer’s disease and age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis ( Hong et al . , 2016; Knickelbein et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2018; Loveless et al . , 2018 ) . Complement may orchestrate peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) disorders as well . For instance , nociceptive hypersensitivities , sensory neuropathies , and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been linked to aberrant complement activation ( Rosoklija et al . , 2000; Ramaglia et al . , 2008; Jang et al . , 2010; Fritzinger and Benjamin , 2016; Xu et al . , 2018; Susuki et al . , 2007 ) . However , the mechanistic role of complement is not well understood in neuroinflammatory pathologies impacting the PNS . Moreover , the pathophysiological trigger of sensory fiber retraction which contributes to sensation loss and in some instances chronic pain is unclear ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Available treatments for peripheral neuropathies primarily focus on clinical symptoms without addressing the underlying pathomechanisms ( Colloca et al . , 2017 ) . Accordingly , elucidation of relevant pathomechanisms underlying sensory neuropathies may translate into efficacious mechanism-based therapeutics . The complement cascade is comprised of dozens of soluble and membrane-bound factors essential for host defense and efficient clearance of cellular debris . However , proper regulation of complement activation is necessary to balance immune responses and prevent collateral tissue damage ( Ricklin et al . , 2016 ) . The complement cascade pivots upon activation of complement component 3 ( C3 ) for its downstream proinflammatory effects . The pathogenic contributions of complement in systemic disease have been reviewed extensively in recent years ( Dobó et al . , 2018; Hajishengallis et al . , 2017; McGeer et al . , 2017; Ricklin et al . , 2016 ) . Nonetheless , emerging concepts centering on complement effector synthesis within inflamed tissue microenvironments have ushered in a ‘renaissance’ of novel complement-targeted drug development strategies ( Ricklin et al . , 2018; Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . Therefore , elucidating whether the complement cascade is a viable therapeutic target in inflammation-associated peripheral nerve impairment remains medically important . The eye has been labeled a ‘complement dysregulation hotspot’ due to complement’s contributions to many ophthalmic diseases , but complement activation is restricted in the healthy cornea ( Clark and Bishop , 2018 ) . As observed in AMD , subtle inflammatory reactions in the eye can mediate significant visual morbidity . Accordingly , ocular inflammation is tightly regulated by various anatomic , physiologic , and immunologic mechanisms in order to maintain visual acuity ( Amouzegar et al . , 2016; Streilein , 2003; Taylor et al . , 2018 ) . These homeostatic mechanisms , collectively dubbed ‘ocular immune privilege , ’ help preserve the ocular surface and enable the cornea to properly focus incoming light onto the retina . Furthermore , corneal nerves are increasingly recognized as central regulators of immune privilege at the ocular surface ( Guzmán et al . , 2018; Neelam et al . , 2018; Paunicka et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , inflammatory events that damage corneal nerves can have insidious consequences in terms of ocular surface health and transparency ( Müller et al . , 2003; Shaheen et al . , 2014; Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . One such pathway that can rapidly initiate inflammation following activation is the complement cascade . Corneal nerves originate predominantly from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal ganglion ( TG ) , and these peripheral nerves provide the cornea with the highest density of sensory fibers in the human body . While the cornea and peripheral nerves constitutively synthesize complement proteins ( Bora et al . , 2008; de Jonge et al . , 2004 ) , the role of the complement cascade in corneal nerve damage has not been explored . Nonetheless , the complement pathway is poised for vigorous activation in the cornea in response to noxious or inflammatory stimuli ( Bora et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , C3 activation has been reported in the cornea soon after infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) , which is a common cause of corneal sensory nerve damage in patients ( Royer et al . , 2017; Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2014 ) . Given the cornea’s high density of sensory nerves , it is particularly amenable for investigating the mechanistic role of complement in peripheral nerve damage . To this end , we evaluated corneal nerve integrity and mechano-sensory function using a murine model of ocular HSV-1 infection to test the hypothesis that local complement activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage . The pathobiology underlying non-penetrating corneal nerve damage is not well understood , although inflammation is generally recognized as an important feature ( Neelam et al . , 2018; Shaheen et al . , 2014; Cruzat et al . , 2015; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2016; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017a ) . While HSV-1 is a clinically prominent cause of corneal nerve damage and sensation loss , a variety of pathogenic microbes impair the corneal nerve architecture upon ocular infection ( Cruzat et al . , 2015 ) . This observation adds to evidence that the neurotropism of HSV-1 is not directly responsible for nerve damage ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2016 ) . In addition to sensation loss evoked by HSV-1 , corneal nerve alterations in other contexts such as dry eye disease are associated with a broad array of neuropathic clinical symptoms including dryness , itch , and pain ( Andersen et al . , 2017 ) . To further qualify the possible role of complement in corneal nerve damage independent of infection , we evaluated corneal mechanosensory function in two noninfectious T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . For this purpose , we utilized established murine models of allergic eye disease ( AED ) and ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Our rationale for this is that complement has been implicated in the etiology of systemic GVHD and allergic inflammation ( Gour et al . , 2018; Kwan et al . , 2012; Ma et al . , 2014; Nguyen et al . , 2018; Zhang and Köhl , 2010 ) . However , a neuroinflammatory role of complement has not been described for either disease within the eye . The translational relevance of this study is underscored by in vivo confocal microscopy data from multiple clinical studies showing architectural changes in the corneal nerves of patients with herpetic keratitis , chronic ocular allergy , and ocular GVHD ( Hamrah et al . , 2010; Müller et al . , 2015; Moein et al . , 2018; Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011; Leonardi et al . , 2012; Tepelus et al . , 2017; He et al . , 2017a ) . Elucidating the pathomechanisms underlying corneal nerve damage may enable development of more effective therapeutics to mitigate progression of such ocular surface inflammatory diseases . Each of the animal models utilized herein mimic clinically important , chronic ocular surface morbidities . Herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) is a common cause of neurotropic keratitis and remains a leading cause of infectious corneal blindness ( Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2014; Farooq and Shukla , 2012 ) . The incidence of ocular allergy exceeds twenty percent of the population with varying degrees of neurogenic ocular surface discomfort that can severely diminish quality of life ( Craig et al . , 2017; Patel et al . , 2017; Saban et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , GVHD is the greatest cause of non-relapse morbidity following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) used to treat life-threatening malignancies and immunologic diseases ( MacDonald et al . , 2017 ) . A majority of patients with chronic presentations of GVHD suffer from ocular surface involvement ( Shikari et al . , 2013 ) . \n",
      " Adaptive immunity has been shown to prevent recovery of corneal sensory function following ocular HSV-1 infection ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , but the initial pathophysiological triggers of denervation and sensation loss are not definitively characterized . Ocular HSV-1 infection provokes corneal denervation and sensation loss between days 5 to 8 post-infection ( p . i . ) in immunologically naive C57BL/6 mice ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . This tempo appears to be synchronized with the host transition from innate to adaptive immunity following infection . Indeed , corneal nerve fiber retraction was evident upon T cell infiltration in the cornea ( Figure 1A ) . Accordingly , we hypothesized that local complement activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage during HSV-1 infection . To address our hypothesis , corneal sensation and pathogen burden were evaluated in C57BL/6 wildtype ( WT ) and complement C3-deficient ( C3-/- ) mice following ocular HSV-1 infection . Progressive loss of corneal mechano-sensitivity was evident in WT mice by days 5 to 8 p . i . , but corneal sensation was conserved in the C3-/- cohort ( Figure 1B ) . The same trend revealing preservation of corneal sensation in C3-/- animals was also observed with an increased HSV-1 challenge inoculum ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Viral titers were measured at time points before and after the onset of corneal sensation loss to determine whether the divergence in sensation stemmed from a differential susceptibility to infection . On day 3 p . i . , the HSV-1 burden was similar in the tear film , corneas , and TG of WT and C3-/- animals ( Figure 1C–D ) . By day 7 p . i . , HSV-1 titers were elevated in the tear film and TG of C3-/- mice relative to WT ( Figure 1C , E ) . Corneal buttons from WT mice exhibited extensive denervation with CD3+ T cell infiltration at day 8 p . i . ( Figure 1F ) . However , T cell infiltration was observed without widespread denervation in C3-/- corneas ( Figure 1F ) . The number of cornea-infiltrating CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were similar among WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 1G ) . Together , these data indicate that corneal sensation loss in herpetic keratitis involves a C3-dependent inflammatory process independent of viral burden . Although T cells successfully extravasate into the corneas of WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 1F , G ) , C3-deficiency can have broad impacts on T cell priming , clonal expansion , and recruitment ( Clarke and Tenner , 2014; West et al . , 2018 ) . To investigate this possibility , corneas from HSV-1-infected WT and C3-/- mice were evaluated for chemokines associated with T cell recruitment , and the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes ( MLN ) were harvested to evaluate T cell responses . Chemokines associated with T cell recruitment were elevated in corneas from both WT and C3-/- mice at day 5 p . i . —a time consistent with onset of sensation loss ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , CD4+ and CD8+ T cell expansion was comparable within the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes ( MLN ) from WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 2B ) . Similarly , T cells harvested from WT and C3-/- mice at day 8 p . i . responded equally to in vitro stimulation in terms of IFNγ production ( Figure 2C ) . Collectively , these data show that C3-/- T cells exhibit normal expansion and recruitment to the cornea during ocular HSV-1 infection . In support of our hypothesis that C3 and T cells jointly coordinate corneal sensation loss , frank corneal sensation loss was not observed following ocular HSV-1 infection in C3-sufficient , alpha-beta T cell receptor-deficient mice ( TCRα-/- ) which congenitally lack classical CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ( Figure 2D ) . To investigate potential functional defects of C3-/- T cells in an in vivo context , CD3+ T cells were harvested from HSV-infected WT or C3-/- mice at day 8 p . i . and adoptively transferred into TCRα-/- mice . Six days following cell transfer , TCRα-/- recipients were infected with HSV-1 and corneal sensation monitored longitudinally . Adoptive transfer of CD3+ T cells from either WT or C3-/- donors evoked progressive corneal sensation loss in TCRα-/- recipients by day 8 p . i . ( Figure 2D ) . These findings further corroborate that C3-/- T cells remain functional in vivo . Analysis of corneal sensation was not feasible beyond 8 days p . i . , as the TCRα-/- mice succumbed to herpetic encephalitis . However , engraftment of donor cells was confirmed by analysis of T cells in the eye-draining MLN of recipient mice by flow cytometry at day 8 p . i . The baseline lymphocyte counts in MLN from TCRα-/- controls likely reflect expansion of non-classical T cell populations ( Viney et al . , 1994 ) . An increase in total cell number was observed for CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells upon adoptive transfer of purified CD3+ T cells into TCRα-/- recipient mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Consistent with this observation , our data show that transfer of CD3+ T cells from HSV-infected mice have no appreciable impact on HSV-1 titers in the TG of TCRα-/- recipients by day 8 p . i . ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . Notably , bulk transfer of HSV-specific CD8+ T cells has been shown to reduce viral burden in the peripheral nervous system of C57BL/6 mice during acute HSV-1 infection ( Conrady et al . , 2009; Royer et al . , 2016 ) . Our collective findings reveal that C3 and T cells are individually necessary and interdependent in the pathogenesis of HSV-1-associated corneal sensation loss . Whether by direct or indirect mechanisms , these data support a paradigm in which C3 activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage in herpetic keratitis . Our data show that T cells contribute to corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection , yet whether this pathology is dependent upon CD4+ or CD8+ T cells remained unclear . To better discern the contributions of each subset , CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were harvested from infected WT mice , transferred into separate groups of TCRα-/- mice , and recipient mice subsequently infected with HSV-1 . Corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection was only observed upon reconstitution with CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3A ) . Donor cell engraftment was confirmed by flow cytometry , although a statistically significant increase in cell number within the eye-draining MLN was only observed upon transfer of CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The requirement for antigen specificity was subsequently evaluated during acute HSV-1 infection by monitoring corneal sensation in WT and OT-II transgenic mice that generate ovalbumin ( OVA ) -specific CD4 T cells . Transgenic OT-II mice did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following infection despite evidence of bystander CD4+ T cell activation and recruitment into the cornea ( Figure 3B–D ) . Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells from HSV-infected WT and OT-II mice into TCRα-/- recipients corroborated these findings ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Abrasion of the corneal epithelium , which is required to mediate infection in this model , induces local chemokine expression capable of recruiting T cells to the cornea even in the absence of viral infection ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) . Nonetheless , active corneal HSV-1 infection was necessary to provoke corneal sensation loss , as TCRα-/- mice reconstituted with CD4+ T cells harvested from HSV-infected WT mice did not elicit auto/allo-antigen-associated sensation loss within two weeks of corneal scratch injury ( i . e . mock infection ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . Collectively , our data show that complement C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are simultaneously necessary to drive corneal sensation loss during HSV-1 infection . These results strongly portend that a coordinated inflammatory axis exists involving C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells , and that it is responsible for sensory neuropathy in herpetic keratitis . Complement-mediated tissue pathology can arise from complement activators synthesized by the liver ( systemic complement ) or in tissue microenvironments ( local complement ) . While local complement activation and regulation have been reported in the cornea in health and disease ( Bora et al . , 1993; Clark and Bishop , 2018; Mondino and Brady , 1981; Verhagen et al . , 1992 ) , the expression profile and cellular sources of various complement components have not been investigated in the context of ocular HSV-1 infection . To this end , a modest array of complement component transcripts was evaluated by semiquantitative real-time PCR on corneal buttons from healthy and HSV-infected mice at day 2 and 7 p . i . Upregulation of complement effectors and anaphylatoxin receptors were noted including C3 , C5 , C3ar1 , and C5ar1 ( Figure 4A , B ) . Constitutive expression of complement receptor 2 ( CD21 ) has been reported in the corneal epithelium ( Levine et al . , 1990 ) , but variances in its expression during HSV-1 infection were not statistically significant across the time points evaluated ( Figure 4B ) . Likewise , no differences in the local expression of various complement regulators were observed in HSV-infected corneas aside from the C1-inhibitor SerpinG1 ( Table 1 , Figure 4C ) . Collectively , this expression profile favors local complement activation , as effectors are upregulated without proportional enhancement of pathway regulatory components . As C3 is the central component of the complement activation pathway , the cellular sources of complement C3 were evaluated in corneas infected with HSV-1 . Monocytes and tissue macrophages are known sources of C3 ( Einstein et al . , 1977; Lubbers et al . , 2017; Morgan and Gasque , 1997; Verschoor et al . , 2001 ) , thus CSF1R+ cells from the peripheral blood of transgenic CSF1R-GFP mice ( MAFIA ) were utilized as the relative standard for C3 transcript expression . Expression of C3 was noted in CD45+ leukocytes isolated from infected corneas , yet detection of C3 expression was lost when CSF1R+ cells were removed from the total CD45+ pool . In addition , isolated EpCAM+ corneal epithelial cells expressed C3 at levels comparable to blood monocytes . However , the C3 expression level was greater in whole-cornea preparations than among individual cell fractions ( Figure 4D ) . Taken together , our data show that both tissue-resident non-hematopoietic cells and resident/infiltrating CSF1R+ leukocytes contribute to local C3 expression in the cornea during acute HSV-1 infection . Ocular HSV-1 infection amplifies local complement gene expression , yet whether local control of complement activation can be harnessed to prevent corneal nerve damage has not been explored . From a clinical perspective , modulating complement activation at the ocular surface may be a viable therapeutic option . As a proof of concept , daily ocular cobra venom factor ( CVF ) treatment was explored as a putative method to deplete C3 and preserve corneal sensation during acute HSV-1 infection . Vehicle ( PBS ) -treated mice exhibited corneal sensation loss following HSV-1 infection , but CVF treatment preserved corneal sensation ( Figure 5A ) . Protein levels of C3 remained near baseline in the cornea following CVF treatment during HSV-1 infection , yet vehicle-treated animals exhibited a 300–600% increase in C3 protein levels in the cornea at days 3 and 7 p . i . ( Figure 5B ) . Ocular CVF treatment did not significantly impact systemic serum C3 concentrations throughout the study ( Figure 5C ) . Ocular CVF treatment limited corneal edema during HSV-1 infection relative to the vehicle control ( Figure 5D ) . Consistent with this observation , CVF-treated animals had less leukocytic infiltrate ( CD45+ ) into the cornea at day 3 p . i . and , specifically , fewer infiltrating CSF1R+ cells ( Figure 5E , F ) . By day 7 p . i . , no difference in total CD45+ or CSF1R+ cells were observed in the cornea , yet there was a reduction in the total number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells ( Figure 5G ) . Despite the difference in CSF1R+ cell infiltration into the corneas at day 3 p . i . , HSV-1 titers were similar in the corneas and TG comparing vehicle- and CVF-treated animals ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) . By day 7 p . i . CVF-treated animals had less virus in the corneas and TG than vehicle controls ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) , suggesting that CVF may have unexpected antiviral effects . However , CVF treatment did not have any discernable impact on T cell expansion in the eye-draining MLN or the total number of circulating CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells in HSV-1 infected animals ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . Collectively , these findings imply that complement-targeted therapeutics could be tailored for ophthalmic use to limit tissue inflammation and preserve corneal sensation . While complement C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells appear to coordinate corneal sensation loss in herpetic keratitis , it remained to be determined whether this phenomenon was specific to HSV-1 infection . To this end , corneal sensation was measured independent of infection in two T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . Murine models of allergic eye disease ( AED ) and ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) were employed to further delineate the hypothesized role of T cells in coordinating corneal nerve damage ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . First , AED was induced using an established systemic ovalbumin ( OVA ) -sensitization and ocular challenge model ( Figure 6A ) mimicking aspects of chronic keratoconjunctivitis ( Ahadome et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Clinical signs of ocular allergy developed as anticipated in OVA-challenged mice ( Figure 6B ) , yet corneal sensation loss was not observed ( Figure 6C ) . Consistent with development of AED , corneas from OVA-challenged mice exhibited CD3+ T cell infiltration by challenge day 7 ( Figure 6D ) . However , frank corneal nerve loss was not observed in AED ( Figure 6D ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the preservation of corneal nerve density during AED ( Figure 6E ) , although CD3+ T cell numbers were elevated in sensitized animals relative to healthy controls ( Figure 6F ) . Flow cytometry was used to verify that the cornea-infiltrating T cells were predominately CD4+ in the AED model ( Figure 6G ) . Although clinical data show that corneal nerve remodeling can occur in patients with chronic ocular allergy ( Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011 ) , allergy symptoms were not accompanied by frank loss of corneal mechano-sensation in the AED animal model . Corneal sensation was also evaluated in a T cell-dependent allogeneic model of chronic GVHD with systemic and ocular manifestations following hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplantation ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) . This minor histocompatibility antigen mismatch model was established by transferring HSC-rich bone marrow ( BM ) and purified T cells from C57BL/6 ( H2b ) donors into lethally irradiated sex-matched C3 . SW-H2b recipients . Recipient controls that receive BM without T cells recover and do not develop GVHD ( Figure 7A ) . Onset of GVHD was established by transfer of BM with CD4+ T cells only , CD8+ T cells only , or both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells . Progressive corneal sensation loss was observed following transfer of CD4+ T cells with and without addition of CD8+ T cells . Addition of CD8+ T cells alone evoked a transient corneal sensation deficit that recovered by day 26 post-transplant . However , corneal sensation loss was not observed in the BM only control group ( Figure 7B ) . External signs of ocular disease ( see Table 2 ) were also apparent in groups receiving CD4+ T cells by the study endpoint ( Figure 7C ) . The presence of tissue-infiltrating CD3+ T cells in corneas from animals with GVHD was verified by confocal microscopy at the study endpoint . Consistent with sensation loss , corneal nerve integrity was markedly reduced in groups receiving CD4+ T cells ( Figure 7D ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the CD4-dependent decrease in corneal nerve density ( Figure 7E ) and concomitant increase in total CD3+ cells ( Figure 7F ) . Taken together , our data show for the first time that corneal sensation loss occurs early in ocular GVHD and that this pathology is instigated in part by allogeneic CD4+ T cells . The pharmacologic impact of local CVF treatment on ocular GVHD progression was consequently explored in order to identify whether the CD4+ T cell-associated corneal sensation loss observed in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GVHD shared a common C3-codependent pathomechanism . For these experiments , GVHD was established in C3 . SW-H2b recipients by transfer of C57BL/6-derived BM and CD3+ T cells . Recipients from the BM only control and GVHD cohorts received ophthalmic treatment with either PBS or CVF ( Figure 8A ) . Systemic disease progressed equally in both GVHD cohorts regardless of treatment ( Figure 8B ) . Although CVF administration was limited to the eye , systemic serum C3 concentrations were lower in the GVHD cohort treated with CVF compared to the PBS-treated GVHD groups at the study endpoint . Nonetheless , the inverted CD4:CD8 T cell ratio ( Herretes et al . , 2015 ) in the spleens and eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes of both groups of GVHD mice confirmed the presence of systemic disease ( Figure 8D ) . Despite development of systemic disease , local CVF treatment preserved corneal nerve integrity and mechano-sensory function in ocular GVHD ( Figure 8E , F ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks from the study endpoint corroborated the preservation of corneal nerve density in CVF-treated mice from the GVHD cohort ( Figure 8G ) , although CVF did not reduce the number of total CD3+ cells during GVHD relative to PBS ( Figure 8H ) . In addition , CVF treatment also limited GVHD-associated periocular disease in female but not in male mice ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) . In summary , these preclinical models establish that CD4+ T cells and complement C3 coordinate corneal sensory nerve damage in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GHVD . Moreover , our data provide a proof of principle that complement-targeted therapeutics may limit the severity of immune-mediated sensory nerve damage at the ocular surface . \n",
      " Mechanistic advances in our understanding of the complement cascade’s physiologic regulation and pathologic contributions in disease have predictably spawned substantial investments in complement-targeted drug development over the past decade ( Harris et al . , 2018; Ricklin et al . , 2018; Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . The ocular surface is a unique milieu in which pharmacologic modulation of the complement pathway may limit the severity of inflammatory disease and improve clinical outcomes . This study provides proof of concept that such interventions may have important clinical impacts on ocular surface disease , and specifically neuropathic sensory disorders affecting the cornea . Complement-targeted drug development for ophthalmic use has almost exclusively focused on AMD with some interest in neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) , Stargardt disease , and autoimmune uveitis ( Harris et al . , 2018; Pittock et al . , 2013 ) . By July 2019 , there were no complement-specific therapeutics indicated for ocular surface use registered on www . clinicaltrials . gov ( search strings: ‘complement’ / ‘C3’ / ‘C5’ / ‘eculizumab’ AND ‘cornea’ , ‘conjunctiva’ , ‘dry eye’ , ‘keratitis’ , OR ‘ocular surface’ ) . Nonetheless , the complement pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology of several ocular surface diseases ( Bora et al . , 2008 ) . The current investigation provides an important advancement in this arena by demonstrating that dysregulated complement activation can specifically contribute to sensory nerve damage in the cornea . While corneal nerves are increasingly implicated in maintenance of corneal immune privilege ( Paunicka et al . , 2015; Neelam et al . , 2018; Guzmán et al . , 2018 ) , this study is the first to identify that C3 is involved in the pathobiology of corneal sensory nerve damage . However , the individual fates of damaged corneal nerves were not explored herein . Lessons from peripheral nerve injury in other settings indicate that some damaged nerves undergo apoptosis , yet effectively promoting functional regeneration of surviving neurons remains a major clinical hurtle ( Doron-Mandel et al . , 2015; Menorca et al . , 2013; Scheib and Höke , 2013; Shacham-Silverberg et al . , 2018 ) . Likewise , promoting functional regeneration of damaged corneal nerves is important for restoration of immune privilege and ocular surface health . Our approach evaluated sensory nerve damage in murine models of T cell-dependent ocular surface disease including HSV-1 keratitis , OVA-induced AED , and ocular GHVD . The lack of a sensory phenotype in the AED model was unanticipated in light of evidence that patients with severe allergy exhibit changes in corneal nerve morphology ( Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011; Leonardi et al . , 2012 ) . This contrasting model underscores the context-dependency of sensation loss during corneal inflammation . While we focused on C3 in HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD due to the direct link to overt corneal sensation loss , complement may still have an important role in mediating neurogenic hypersensitivities in AED . In addition to loss of mechano-sensory function , corneal nerve pathologies can involve a broad array of neuropathic clinical symptoms including dryness , itch , and pain ( Andersen et al . , 2017 ) . Inflammatory mediators facilitate neuropathic hypersensitivities , but the therapeutic potential of complement inhibition is often overlooked ( Baral et al . , 2019; Fritzinger and Benjamin , 2016 ) . Moreover , the cornea produces many neurotrophic factors that influence sensory innervation in health and disease ( Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2017; Yu et al . , 2015 ) . Given the involvement of C3 activation in sensory nerve damage , future investigation into crosstalk between complement and other neurotropic factors in the cornea is warranted . Furthermore , AED is driven primarily by a combined Th2/Th17 CD4 T cell response that differs from the Th1 bias observed in HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Saban et al . , 2013; Tang and Hendricks , 1996 ) . This suggests that Th1 cytokines such as IFNγ , IL-2 , and lymphotoxin-alpha may be important in coordinating corneal sensation loss . Nonetheless , the unique inflammatory milieus and differential polarizations of cornea-infiltrating T cells across these disease models may also influence the downstream effects of complement activation in the tissue microenvironment ( Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . Future studies are needed to broaden the scope of these observations to other peripheral nerve diseases . For example , complement-mediated microvascular damage in diabetes correlates with neuropathy ( Rasmussen et al . , 2018; Rosoklija et al . , 2000 ) . While diabetic peripheral neuropathy can lead to neurotropic corneal ulcerations ( Gao et al . , 2016b ) , the role of complement in diabetic corneal disease is currently unknown . Complement enhances clearance of infected cells and nascent virions during HSV-1 infection ( Kostavasili et al . , 1997; Lubinski et al . , 2002; McNearney et al . , 1987 ) . Importantly , HSV-1 can also evade C3 activation through endogenous expression of glycoprotein C ( gC ) . By limiting C3b deposition on infected cells and nascent virions , gC can inhibit subsequent C5 binding and membrane attack complex ( MAC ) formation ( Kostavasili et al . , 1997; Lubinski et al . , 2002; McNearney et al . , 1987; Tegla et al . , 2011 ) . This could explain why herpetic keratitis is less severe in rabbits infected with a gC-deficient strain of HSV-1 during acute infection ( Drolet et al . , 2004 ) . However , this gC-mediated viral evasion strategy may also be cell type-dependent . Cell culture modeling indicates that neuronal cells maintain host-encoded complement regulator expression more efficiently and are more resistant to MAC deposition than epithelial cells upon HSV-1 infection ( Rautemaa et al . , 2002 ) . Accordingly , complement-mediated sensory nerve damage in HSV-1 keratitis may reflect a maladaptive outcome of host-defense . This is consistent with our data showing that immunologically naive C3-/- mice maintain corneal sensation and innervation , yet they exhibit concomitant enhancement of viral shedding in the tear film and increased viral burden in the TG by day 7 p . i . The absence of a concordant difference in HSV-1 titers in corneas from WT and C3-/- mice is likely explained by the potent antiviral effects of type-1 interferon ( Conrady et al . , 2011; Royer and Carr , 2016 ) . This suggests that the maintenance of corneal innervation in C3-/- mice enables enhanced shedding of nascent virions produced within the TG . Moreover , there is no difference in the amount of latent HSV-1 in the TG of naive WT and C3-/- mice 30 days after ocular HSV-1 challenge ( Royer et al . , 2019 ) . Taken together , this evidence indicates that although C3 is involved in progression of keratitis and sensory nerve fiber retraction during acute infection , it likely does not contribute to complete elimination of infected nerves . The studies reported herein involve immunologically naive mice , but the impacts of preexisting humoral immune responses on complement pathway activation and regulation in the cornea during HSV-1 infection remain incompletely understood . This point is of considerable importance clinically , as herpes-associated neurotropic keratitis typically develops as a result of recurrent corneal infections in patients ( Hamrah et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , we have recently reported that C3 is essential for optimal antibody-dependent viral clearance following ocular HSV-1 challenge in mice ( Royer et al . , 2019; Royer et al . , 2017 ) . While vaccinated animals did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following ocular HSV-1 infection in those studies , deposition of the terminal C3 cleavage product C3d was present in the corneal epithelium ( Royer et al . , 2017 ) . Host gene expression data herein corroborates that HSV-1 infection creates an imbalance in the local complement effector to regulator expression ratios that contribute to aberrant complement pathway activation in the cornea . This imbalance in ‘complement proteostasis’ may favor deposition of complement fragments and sublytic MAC on corneal sensory nerve fibers ( Tegla et al . , 2011; Triantafilou et al . , 2013 ) . Notwithstanding , the nerve-intrinsic molecular mechanisms responsible for trigeminal sensory fiber retraction , neuronal death , or axonal regeneration in the cornea are largely unknown ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Future work is needed to identify the respective complement activation pathways involved in pathologic and protective immune responses to HSV-1 in the cornea . Identification of the complement pathway’s role in initiating corneal sensation loss following HSV-1 infection is an important advancement in the mechanistic understanding of this disease process , as it introduces an array of potential drug targets for local therapy . Previous observations note that complement activation in antigen-induced keratitis may be mediated by cellular immune mechanisms ( Verhagen et al . , 1992 ) . The identification of CSF1R+ macrophages/monocytes as a local source of C3 during infection ( Figure 4D ) is also critical , as these cells are recruited to the cornea in the early stages of HSV-1 infection and are associated with corneal nerve damage in HSV-1 keratitis ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Conrady et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , CD4 T cells coordinate this pathology . Our data corroborate findings from the Hendricks’ lab showing that CD4 T cells are associated with corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 keratitis ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , yet our adoptive transfer experiments establish that this process is not dependent upon endogenous C3 production by cornea-infiltrating donor T cells ( Figure 2D ) . Notably , the tempo of HSV-associated sensation loss was consistent among models once initiated ( Figure 1B , Figure 2D , Figure 3A ) . However , the initial onset was delayed by one day in the adoptive transfer model . This likely reflects the relative lymphopenic status of T cell-reconstituted TCRα-/- mice compared to WT mice ( compare Figure 2B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 infection and ocular GVHD shared a common mechanism dependent upon CD4+ T cells and complement C3 . The role of intracellular C3 in regulating human Th1 responses has received much attention in recent years ( Elvington et al . , 2017; Hansen et al . , 2019; Liszewski et al . , 2013 ) . Such studies involve CD3 and CD46 stimulation to activate human CD4 T cells in vitro . However , mice do not express CD46 . Instead , anaphylatoxin receptor signaling has been shown to modulate Th1 cytokine production in murine T cells ( Strainic et al . , 2008 ) . Our ex vivo re-stimulation data clearly show that there is no defect in IFNγ production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice following HSV-1 infection . Others have shown similar data based on T cell proliferation in response to re-stimulation with HSV-1 antigen ( Da Costa et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast , a reduction in IFNγ production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice was reported following in vitro expansion under Th1 polarizing conditions ( Liszewski et al . , 2013 ) . Nonetheless , it is possible that anaphylatoxin receptor signaling from locally produced C3a ( and potentially C5a generated downstream ) modulates T cell effector function upon extravasation into the inflamed cornea . The precise relationships between T cells and C3 in our mouse models of corneal neuropathic disease remain to be identified . Our working hypothesis involves an indirect mechanism whereby sublytic MAC deposition from local complement activation damages sensory nerves , which are then cleared by T cell-activated phagocytes or other cytolytic cells . These could include tissue-resident and infiltrating leukocytes ( macrophages , monocytes , dendritic cells , and NK cells ) as well as nerve-associated corneal epithelial cells ( Buela and Hendricks , 2015; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Gao et al . , 2016a; Koyama and Hill , 2016; Liu et al . , 2017; Royer et al . , 2018; Seyed-Razavi et al . , 2014; Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Emerging evidence indicates that the plasma membranes of corneal nerves and epithelial cells fuse thereby enabling cytosolic exchange ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . In light of this , it is plausible that complement-mediated damage to corneal epithelial cells has a direct impact on sensory nerves . Although corneal nerve damage is an established pathology in animal models of HSV-1 infection ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015; He et al . , 2017b; Yun et al . , 2014 ) , this is the first report documenting loss of corneal mechano-sensory function in ocular GVHD . Notably , patients rarely exhibit neurological manifestations of GVHD affecting other tissues/organs ( Grauer et al . , 2010 ) . Corneal sensation loss may provide a clinical benchmark for initiation of targeted therapies to curb progression of ocular GVHD in patients . Data from our animal model of GVHD suggest that corneal sensation loss is an early warning sign of progressive ocular and systemic GVHD . Corneal sensation measurements are warranted in patients following HSCT to substantiate this finding among those who develop chronic GVHD . Published imaging studies confirm that corneal nerve remodeling occurs in patients with ocular GVHD ( He et al . , 2017a; Tepelus et al . , 2017 ) ; therefore , clinical studies to delineate the kinetics of disease onset are needed . Complement C3 is a known driver of systemic GVHD ( Kwan et al . , 2012; Ma et al . , 2014; Seignez et al . , 2017 ) , and our data show that aberrant complement pathway activation also contributes to the pathogenesis of ocular GVHD including corneal sensation loss . Furthermore , localized CVF treatment preserved corneal sensation in both sexes during ocular GVHD , but treatment only abrogated other facets of ocular surface disease in female mice . This dimorphic outcome may reflect insufficient maintenance of C3 depletion in the ocular surface microenvironment , as animals were only treated twice weekly . Furthermore , complement activity is reportedly limited by terminal pathway components in female mice compared to males ( Kotimaa et al . , 2016 ) . Collectively , our data suggest that sensory nerve involvement may be a unique facet and treatment target in ocular GVHD . While the complement pathway has many components , C3 is the heart of the pathway and its activation products mediate virtually all downstream pathway functions . Accordingly , we used CVF to target complement activation in models of HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD as a proof of concept for local delivery of complement-targeted therapeutics for ocular surface disease . In contrast to the neurotoxic effects of complete cobra venom , purified CVF is a ‘nontoxic’ derivative . CVF forms a biochemically stable convertase to rapidly hydrolyze mammalian C3 and C5 . This ultimately results in complement inactivation via effector consumption ( Vogel and Fritzinger , 2010 ) . The only recorded side effect of purified CVF administration in rodents is transitory anaphylatoxin-mediated pulmonary inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress ( Proctor et al . , 2006; Vogel and Fritzinger , 2010 ) . In our hands , respiratory distress was observed in some mice following the initial sub-conjunctival CVF injection irrespective of group assignment ( animals were euthanized ) . However , topical CVF administration did not provoke respiratory or corneal abnormalities in any animals . Previous findings also show that topical CVF administration has no obvious effects on corneal health or transparency ( Zaidi et al . , 2010 ) . Experimental CVF administration was once thought to directly stimulate T cells , but such effects were later attributed to mitogen contamination ( Rumjanek et al . , 1978; Cauvi et al . , 2012 ) . Because our disease models were T cell-dependent , we utilized highly-purified CVF from a commercial source for our studies . Moreover , we found no evidence to suggest that CVF impacted T cell responses outside of the eye . Local CVF treatment reduced corneal T cell infiltration following HSV-1 infection ( Figure 5G ) . However , this is likely due to reduced inflammation overall in C3-depleted corneas ( Figure 5D ) . Likewise , ocular CVF treatment in the GVHD model did not impact on the total numbers of T cells in the corneas at the experiment endpoint . However , we have not excluded the possibility that CVF treatment may delay the tempo of T cell influx . Nonetheless , CVF administration preserved corneal sensation in both disease models . By addressing the ‘heart’ of the complement pathway ( C3 ) , this study opens the door to future investigation to further elucidate the relevant pathomechanisms and corresponding therapeutic targets . The relevant complement activation pathways ( classical , alternative , lectin , terminal ) , cellular targets , and impacts of anaphylatoxin receptor signaling are topics of future investigation . Complement activation is a double-edged sword in the cornea , as activation can be either protective or harmful . Low-level complement turnover is observed in healthy corneas/tears , and complement may even contribute to the relative ‘paucibacterial’ state of the ocular surface microbiome ( Doan et al . , 2016; McDermott , 2013; Willcox et al . , 1997 ) . The mechanisms regulating each complement-mediated effect remain incompletely understood . Elucidation of how complement activation is triggered , the relevant molecular mechanisms of its downstream signaling , and contributions to pathology will promote an important advancement in drug development for ocular surface disease . Animal models are necessary for mechanistic studies when it comes to understanding complement pathway regulation , especially in dynamic tissue microenvironments; however , differences in complement regulation exist between mouse and man that will also have to be resolved to further assess the translational potential ( Jacobson and Weis , 2008 ) . This certainly applies to putative complement-targeted therapeutics for ocular surface treatment . Even among individual patients , small nucleotide polymorphisms evoke changes in complement activity that have major impacts on disease risks . Such genetic linkages , dubbed ‘complotype , ’ are important in differential susceptibility to AMD ( Harris et al . , 2012; Paun et al . , 2016 ) . Accordingly , complotype differences may help explain differential susceptibility patterns in a variety of ocular surface diseases . Our data herein have demonstrated successful prophylactic intervention in repressing complement-mediated sensory nerve pathology in two well characterized experimental T cell-dependent corneal disease models . Other avenues of future investigation are also needed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic intervention on established ocular surface diseases . Successful implementation of complement-targeted therapeutics for topical ophthalmic use may provide the benefit of controlling insidious ocular surface diseases without the risks associated with systemic therapies . \n",
      " Mouse strains were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . These include: C57BL/6 , C3-/- ( stock #029661 ) , TCRα-/- ( stock # 002116 ) , OT-II ( stock #004194 ) , MAFIA/CSF1R-GFP ( stock #005070 ) , C3 . SW-H2b ( stock #000438 ) , and B6-GFP ( stock #003291 ) . Colonies were maintained in select-pathogen-free vivaria at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center or Duke University Medical Center . Research was performed in accordance with protocols approved by respective institutional animal care and use committees . For all procedures relating to ocular HSV-1 infection , C57BL/6-background mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and euthanized by cardiac perfusion ( Royer et al . , 2018 ) . For infection , corneas were scratched to expose the epithelium and 1000 plaque forming units ( PFU ) of HSV-1 McKrae was applied to each eye . Viral stocks were propagated and infectious titers quantified by standard plaque assay on Vero cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) as previously reported ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . For adoptive transfers , T cells were purified from splenocyte preparations using a BioRad S3e cell sorter ( Hercules , CA ) . Corneal complement C3 depletion was achieved by subconjunctival injection of CVF ( Cat . # 233552 , Millipore Sigma , Burlington , MA ) followed by topical maintenance dosing as described in respective figure legends . Allergic eye disease was initiated in B6 mice as previously described ( Ahadome et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2015; Schlereth et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , hypersensitivity was elicited via intraperitoneal immunization with 10 μg ovalbumin ( OVA ) adjuvanted with 1 mg Alum and 300 ng pertussis toxin ( all from Sigma-Aldrich Corp . , St . Louis , MO ) . Ocular allergy was subsequently induced via daily eyedrop challenge containing 250 μg OVA ( Figure 6A ) . Clinical signs of AED were scored daily using established criteria ( Schlereth et al . , 2012 ) . Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation for tissue collection . Induction of GVHD was based on an established T-dependent , MHC-matched unrelated donor model ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , C3-SW . H2b mice were lethally irradiated ( 10 . 5 Gy , Cs-137 ) and reconstituted with 5 × 106 T cell-depleted bone marrow ( TCD-BM ) cells from allogeneic C57BL/6 ( H2b ) mice . T cell depletion was achieved using BD anti-mouse CD90 . 2 IMag particles ( Cat . # 551518 , San Jose , CA ) . Control groups received TCD-BM only , but GVHD onset required reconstitution with TCD-BM and T cells . T cells were isolated from B6 splenocytes using immunomagnetic microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , San Diego , CA ) targeting CD4 ( Cat . #130-049-201 ) , CD8 ( Cat . #130-116-478 ) , or CD90 . 2 ( Cat . #130-049-101 ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Cell purity was evaluated by flow cytometry ( ~80% ) and adjusted such that 1 . 3 × 106 CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or 2 . 3 × 106 CD3+ T cells were injected into each recipient with TCD-BM . Irradiated animals received water containing gentamicin ( 6 . 6 μg/ml ) for ten days following irradiation ( Henry Schein Animal Health , Dublin , OH ) . Supplical nutritional paste ( Henry Schein ) was also provided ad libitum to reduce weight loss . Systemic manifestations of GVHD were scored using established criteria ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) and ocular disease scored according to Table 2 . Corneal mechano-sensory function was measured on non-anesthetized mice with a Luneau Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer ( Western Ophthalmics , Lynwood , WA ) in 0 . 5 cm increments on a scale of 0 to 6 cm as previously described ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . Sensation scores reflect the longest filament length capable of eliciting replicate blink reflexes when applied to the central cornea . A Bioptigen spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) system ( Leica Microsystems , Buffalo Grove , IL ) was utilized to evaluate corneal inflammation and edema in vivo ( Downie et al . , 2014 ) . Digital photography of the external eye was captured with a Leica MZ16 FA stereomicroscope . Corneal nerves were imaged in flat-mounted corneal buttons as described ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , corneas were harvested with the limbus intact , fixed , permeabilized , and labeled with Abcam anti-mouse beta-III tubulin primary antibody ( Cat . # ab18207 , Cambridge , MA ) and a corresponding AlexaFluor647-conjugated secondary antibody ( Cat . # 711-605-152 , Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA ) . Corneas were also labeled with an eBioscience FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD3ε antibody ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) . Slides were imaged using an Olympus Fluoview1200 laser scanning confocal ( Center Valley , PA ) or a Nikon AR1 HD resonant scanning confocal ( Melville , NY ) microscope with sequential channel scanning . Confocal z-stack images were evaluated using Imaris software ( Bitplane , Concord , MA ) to quantify corneal nerves densities and the total numbers of CD3+ cells . Briefly , images were displayed as maximum intensity projections . Nerve volume per field of view was measured with the ‘create surface tool’ with manual thresholding for voxel area coverage of βIII tubulin+ fibers ( default parameters; smooth surface area detail set to 0 . 5 μm; background subtraction set to 8 . 0 μm ) . Total CD3+ cells were quantified using the spots tool with default parameters , an estimated cell diameter of 8 μm , and classification using the quality filter method with manual thresholding . Morphometric nerve volume and cell count summary statistics were reported by the software per image ( 20x field of view ) . Nerve densities were normalized to the respective control group average . Secondary lymphoid organs were harvested and mechanically processed into single-cell suspensions ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . Blood was collected from the facial vein and treated with erythrocyte lysis buffer prior to labeling . Corneas were digested in RPMI1640 media containing 0 . 26 Wünsch units of Roche LiberaseTL enzyme blend ( Sigma Aldrich ) at 37° C as described ( Royer et al . , 2017 ) . Cell suspensions were filtered and labeled with Fc block and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies ( eBioscience ) . In vitro T cell functional assays were performed as previously described ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , cells were stimulated using 50 ng PMA and 800 ng ionomycin for three hours and monensin added after one hour ( BD Biosciences ) . Intracellular IFNγ expression was evaluated by flow cytometry using a BD cytofix/cytoperm staining kit . Samples were analyzed on a Miltenyi Biotec MacsQuant10 or a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer with MacsQuantify or FacsDiva software , respectively . For downstream gene expression studies , cornea digests were fractionated with Miltenyi microbeads by sequentially targeting CD45 ( Cat . # 130-052-301 ) and EpCAM ( Cat . # 130-105-958 ) as described ( Royer et al . , 2018 ) . Alternatively , GFP-expressing cells were purified or depleted using a BioRad S3e cell sorter . Tissues were harvested and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 1x Calbiochem protease inhibitor cocktail ( Millipore Sigma ) . Serum was obtained by collecting blood from the facial vein into BD microtainer serum separator tubes . Tissue homogenates and serum were clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000×g . Chemokine concentrations were determined using a BioRad Luminex system and Millipore Milliplex MAP technology . Concentrations of C3 were measured by ELISA ( Abcam , Cat . # ab157711 ) . Gene expression studies were performed using RNA isolated from tissue and cells using the Trizol ( ThermoFisher ) method and converted to cDNA with iScript ( BioRad ) . Real-time PCR was performed using PrimePCR technology with commercially validated primer sequences ( Biorad ) and a Biorad CFX-Connect thermocycler as directed . Relative expression was calculated using the 2–ΔΔCt method with GAPDH ( glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ) as a reference gene . Final PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and imaged with an Azure Biosystems C-series gel documentation system ( Dublin , CA ) to confirm C3 expression in cell subsets . All data were evaluated using Prism six software ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA ) . Statistical tests and post hoc analyses utilized are listed in each figure legend . Significance thresholds are indicated as follows *=P < 0 . 05 , **=P < 0 . 01 , ***=P < 0 . 001 for all data . Supporting data are available online .  <end_of_turn>\n",

      "Given this text: In temperate climates , winter deaths exceed summer ones . However , there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality , by local climate , age group , sex and medical cause of death . We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions . Death rates in men and women ≥ 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August , driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries . In these ages , percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions , nor changed from 1980 to 2016 . Under five years , seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s . In adolescents and young adults , especially in males , death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January , driven by injury deaths . \n",
      " It is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year , and in temperate climates there tend to be more deaths in winter than in summer ( Campbell , 2017; Fowler et al . , 2015; Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) . It has therefore been hypothesized that a warmer world may lower winter mortality in temperate climates ( Langford and Bentham , 1995; Martens , 1998 ) . In a large country like the USA , which possesses distinct climate regions , the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically , due to geographical variations in mortality , localized weather patterns , and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating , air conditioning and healthcare ( Davis et al . , 2004; Braga et al . , 2001; Kalkstein , 2013; Medina-Ramón and Schwartz , 2007 ) . The presence and extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time ( Bobb et al . , 2014; Carson et al . , 2006; Seretakis et al . , 1997; Sheridan et al . , 2009 ) . A thorough understanding of the long-term dynamics of seasonality of mortality , and its geographical and demographic patterns , is needed to identify at-risk groups , plan responses at the present time as well as under changing climate conditions . Although mortality seasonality is well-established , there is limited information on how seasonality , including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality , varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death ( Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . In this paper , we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group , through the application of wavelet analytical techniques , to over three decades of national mortality data . Wavelets have been used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena ( Moy et al . , 2002 ) and infectious diseases ( Grenfell et al . , 2001 ) . We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality . In addition , we identify how the percentage difference between death rates in maximum and minimum mortality months has changed over time . \n",
      " The strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate seasonality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determinants and planning responses . \n",
      " We used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , we also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter temperatures . Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time or nationally , or fixed to pre-specified frequencies . Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in the USA ( Feinstein , 2002; Kalkstein , 2013; Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences . Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths , restricted to older ages , are broadly consistent with these studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) , which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . A study of 36 cities in the USA , aggregated across age groups and over time , also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range ( Kinney et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations ( Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) ( the study’s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated ) . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental ( e . g . housing insulation and heating ) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe . If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of ( unintentional ) injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) and are more common in men . The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first , the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined , and second , the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions , which exhibit limited seasonality ( Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and Figure 10—figure supplement 3 ) , increased ( MacDorman and Gregory , 2015 ) . In contrast to young and middle ages , mortality in older ages , where death rates are highest , maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades ( we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages , the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend ) . This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate . Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors , such as better insulation of homes , winter heating provision and flu vaccinations , for the vulnerable older population ( Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group ( Healy , 2003; Lerchl , 1998; Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions ( Morris , 2013 ) . Such interventions are important today , and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability . \n",
      " We used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Age , sex , state of residence , month of death , and underlying cause of death were available for each record . The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases ( ICD ) system ( 9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th revision of ICD thereafter ) . Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 ( Ingram et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation , assigning each yearly count to July . We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Figure 18 and Table 2 ) ( Karl and Koss , 1984 ) . On average , the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18 . 4°C and 18°C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature ( 27 . 9°C in July ) . The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast ( an average range of 17 . 5°C ) . The three coldest climate regions are West North Central , East North Central and the Northwest ( 7 . 6°C , 8 . 0°C , 8 . 2°C respectively ) . Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions , the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region , West North Central ( an average range of 30 . 5°C ) , which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature ( −6 . 5°C in January ) . The other climate regions , Northeast , Southwest , and Central , possess similar average temperatures ( 10°C to 14°C ) and variation within the year of ( 23°C to 26°C ) , with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States ( with 19 . 8% total population in 2016 ) . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4 , 5–14 , 15-24 , 25–34 , 35–44 , 45–54 , 55–64 , 65–74 , 75–84 , 85+ years . We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group , both nationally and for sub-national climate regions . Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months , by multiplying each month’s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month . For analysis of seasonality by cause of death , we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories ( Table 1 ) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note . Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56 . 4% and 21 . 2% of all deaths in the USA , respectively , in 1980 , and 40 . 3% and 22 . 4% , respectively , in 2016 . Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures ( Basu , 2009; Basu and Samet , 2002; Bennett et al . , 2014; Braga et al . , 2002; Gasparrini et al . , 2015 ) . Injuries , which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7 . 3% in 2016 , may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim , which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements ( Dee et al . , 2011 ) . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period . We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence , and frequency , of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series ( Hubbard , 1998; Torrence and Compo , 1998 ) . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere ( Cazelles et al . , 2008 ) , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time . In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white ( an independent random process ) or red ( autoregressive of order one process ) noise . For each age-sex group , we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period ( 1980–2016 ) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum , which represents random fluctuations . We used the R package WaveletComp ( version 1 . 0 ) for the wavelet analysis . Before analysis , we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression , and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and −1 . To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates , we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates . Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate . In taking the weighted average , we allowed December ( month 12 ) to neighbour January ( month 1 ) , representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean ( θ- ) of the angles ( θ1 , θ2 , θ3… , θn , ) representing the deaths ( with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death ) is found using the relation below:θ-=arg∑j=1nexp⁡ ( iθj ) , where arg denotes the complex number argument and θj denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j . The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value ( Fisher , 1995 ) . Along with each circular mean , a 95% confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples . The R package CircStats ( version 0 . 2 . 4 ) was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account . This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start ( 1980 ) and end ( 2016 ) of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death .. \n",
